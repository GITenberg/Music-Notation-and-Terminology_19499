<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The study of <i>music notation and terminology</i> by classes in
conservatories and in music departments of colleges and normal schools
is a comparative innovation, one reason for the non-existence of such
courses in the past being the lack of a suitable text-book, in which
might be found in related groups clear and accurate definitions of the
really essential terms. But with the constantly increasing interest in
music study (both private and in the public schools), and with the
present persistent demand that music teaching shall become more
systematic and therefore more efficient in turning out a more
<i>intelligent</i> class of pupils, it has become increasingly necessary to
establish courses in which the prospective teacher of music (after
having had considerable experience with music itself) might acquire a
concise and accurate knowledge of a fairly large number of terms, most
of which he has probably already encountered as a student, and many of
which he knows the general meaning of, but none of which he perhaps
knows accurately enough to enable him to impart his knowledge clearly
and economically to others.</p>

<p>To meet the need of a text-book for this purpose in his own classes the
author has been for several years gathering material from all available
sources, and it is hoped that the arrangement of this material in
related groups as here presented will serve to give the student not only
some insight into the present meaning of a goodly number of terms, but
will also enable him to see more clearly <i>why</i> certain terms have the
meaning which at present attaches to them. To this latter end the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>derivations of many of the terms are given in connection with their
definition.</p>

<p>The aim has not been to present an exhaustive list, and the selection of
terms has of course been influenced largely by the author's own
individual experience, hence many teachers will probably feel that
important terms have been omitted that should have been included. For
this state of affairs no apology is offered except that it would
probably be impossible to write a book on this subject which would
satisfy everyone in either the selection or actual definition of terms.</p>

<p>In formulating the definitions themselves an attempt has been made to
use such words as <i>note</i>, <i>tone</i>, et cetera with at least a fair degree
of accuracy, and while the attitude of the author on this point may be
criticized as being puristic and pedantic, it is nevertheless his
opinion that the next generation of music students and teachers will be
profited by a more accurate use of certain terms that have been
inaccurately used for so long that the present generation has to a large
extent lost sight of the fact that the use is inaccurate. The author is
well aware of the fact that reform is a matter of growth rather than of
edict, but he is also of the belief that before reform can actually
begin to come, the <i>need</i> of reform must be felt by a fairly large
number of actively interested persons. It is precisely because so few
musicians realize the need of any change in music terminology that the
changes recommended by committees who have given the matter careful
thought are so slow in being adopted. It is hoped that some few points
at which reform in the terminology of music is necessary may be brought
to the attention of a few additional musicians thru this volume, and
that the cause may thus be helped in some slight degree.</p>

<p>It is suggested that in using the book for class-room purposes the
teacher emphasize not only the definition and derivation of all terms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>studied, but the spelling and pronunciation as well. For this latter
purpose a pronouncing index has been appended.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give credit to all sources from which ideas have
been drawn, but especial mention should be made of the eminently clear
and beautifully worded definitions compiled by Professor Waldo S. Pratt
or the Century Dictionary, and the exceedingly valuable articles on an
almost all-inclusive range of topics found in the new edition of Grove's
Dictionary. Especial thanks for valuable suggestions as to the
arrangement of the material, etc., are also due to Dr. Raymond H.
Stetson, Professor of Psychology, Oberlin College; Arthur E. Heacox,
Professor of Theory, Oberlin Conservatory of Music; and Charles I. Rice,
Supervisor of Music, Worcester, Mass., as well as to various members of
the Music Teachers' National Association who have offered valuable
advice along certain specific lines.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Some Principles of Correct Notation</span></h2>


<p><a name="SEC_1">1.</a> The <i>note</i> (from <i>nota</i>&#8212;Latin&#8212;a mark or sign) consists of either
one, two, or three parts, (<img src="images/notes.jpg" width="55" height="24" alt="notes" title="notes" />) these being referred to
respectively as head, stem, and hook. The hook is often called <i>tail</i> or
cross-stroke. The stem appears on the right side of the head when turned
up, but on the left side when turned down.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
<img src="images/quarter.jpg" width="36" height="24" alt="quarter notes" title="quarter notes" /> The hook is
always on the right side.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<img src="images/eighth.jpg" width="39" height="24" alt="eighth notes" title="eighth notes" /></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In writing music with pen the head and hook are best made with
a heavy pressure on the pen point, but in writing at the board
they are most easily made by using a piece of chalk about an
inch long, turned on its side.</p></div>

<p>2. When only one part (or voice) is written on the staff, the following
<i>rules for turning stems</i> apply: (1) If the note-head is <i>below</i> the
third line, the stem must turn up. (2) If the note-head is <i>above</i> the
third line the stem must turn down. (3) If the note-head is <i>on</i> the
third line the stem is turned either up or down with due regard to the
symmetrical appearance of the measure in which the note occurs. The
following examples will illustrate these points.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fig01.jpg" width="700" height="92" alt="Fig. 1" title="Fig. 1" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="music/fig01.mid">[Listen]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>3. When two parts are written on the same staff, the stems of the upper
part all turn up, and those of the lower part turn down, in order that
the parts may be clearly distinguished. (Fig. 2.) But in music for piano
and other instruments on which complete chords can be sounded by <i>one</i>
performer and also in simple, four-part vocal music in which all voices
have approximately the same rhythm, several notes often have one stem in
common as in Fig. 3.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fig02.jpg" width="300" height="87" alt="Fig. 2" title="Fig. 2" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="music/fig02.mid">[Listen]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fig03.jpg" width="300" height="177" alt="Fig. 3" title="Fig. 3" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="music/fig03.mid">[Listen]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>4. Notes of small denomination (eighths and smaller) are often written
in groups of two or more, all stems in the group being then connected by
<i>one cross-stroke</i>. In such a case all the stems must of course be
turned the same way, the direction being determined by the position of
the majority of note-heads in the group. Notes thus <i>stroked</i> may be of
the same or of different denomination. See Fig. 4.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fig04.jpg" width="400" height="90" alt="Fig. 4" title="Fig. 4" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="music/fig04.mid">[Listen]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>In vocal music notes are never thus stroked when a syllable is given to
each note. (See <a href="#Page_19">p. 19</a>, <a href="#SEC_55">Sec. 55</a>, C.)</p>

<p>5. <i>Rests</i>, like notes, are best made with a heavy pen stroke or by
using a piece of chalk on its side. (See note under <a href="#SEC_1">Sec. 1</a>.) The
double-whole rest, whole rest, and half rest occupy the third space
unless for the sake of clearness in writing two parts on the same staff
they are written higher or lower. The rests of smaller denomination may
be placed at any point on the staff, the hooks being always placed on
the spaces. The hook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> of the eighth rest is usually placed on the
<i>third</i> space. Rests are sometimes dotted, but are never tied.</p>

<p>6. The <i>G clef</i> should be begun at the second line rather than below the
staff. Experiments have shown clearly that beginners learn to make it
most easily in this way, and the process may be further simplified by
dividing it into two parts, thus,
<img src="images/gclef.jpg" width="38" height="40" alt="G clef" title="G clef" />. The descending stroke
crosses the ascending curve at or near the fourth line. The circular
part of the curve occupies approximately the first and second spaces.</p>

<p>7. The <i>F clef</i> is made either thus,
<img src="images/bass.jpg" width="20" height="24" alt="bass clef" title="bass clef" />, or thus,
<img src="images/oldbass.jpg" width="20" height="23" alt="old bass clef" title="old bass clef" /> the dots being placed one on either side of the
fourth line of the staff, which is the particular point that the clef
marks. The C <i>clef</i> has also two forms,
<img src="images/cclef1.jpg" width="33" height="24" alt="C clef" title="C clef" /> and
<img src="images/cclef2.jpg" width="16" height="24" alt="C clef" title="C clef" />.</p>

<p>8. The <i>sharp</i> is made with two light vertical strokes, and two heavy
slanting ones, the slant of the latter being upward from left to right,
<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>. The sharp should never be made thus, #.</p>

<p>The <i>double sharp</i> is made either thus
<img src="images/doublesharp.jpg" width="16" height="15" alt="double-sharp" title="double-sharp" /> or
*, the first form being at present the more common.</p>

<p>9. The <i>flat</i> is best made by a down stroke retraced part way up, the
curve being made without lifting pen from paper. The <i>double flat</i>
consists of two flats,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <span lang="el" title="double-flat">&#9837;&#9837;</span>. The <i>natural</i> or <i>cancel</i> is
made in two strokes, down-right and right-down, thus
<img src="images/natural.jpg" width="27" height="24" alt="natural" title="natural" /> <span lang="el" title="natural">&#9838;</span>.</p>

<p>10. The <i>tie</i> usually connects the <i>heads</i> of notes, thus
<img src="images/tie.jpg" width="26" height="24" alt="tie" title="tie" />.</p>

<p>11. The <i>dot after a note</i> always appears on a space, whether the
note-head is on a line or space. (See Fig. 5.) In the case of a dot
after a note on a line, the dot usually appears on the space <i>above</i>
that line if the next note is higher in position and on the space below
it if the following note is lower.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Note.</i>&#8212;Correct notation must be made a habit rather than a
theory, and in order to form the habit of writing correctly,
<i>drill</i> is necessary. This may perhaps be best secured by
asking students to write (at the board or on ruled paper) from
verbal dictation, thus: Teacher says,</p>

<p>&quot;Key of B<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, three-quarter measure: First measure, DO a
quarter note, RE a quarter, and MI a quarter. Second measure,
SOL a quarter, LA a quarter, and SOL a quarter. Third measure,
LA, TI, DO, RE, MI, eighths, stroked in pairs. Fourth measure,
high DO a dotted half.&quot; Pupils respond by writing the exercise
dictated, after which mistakes in the turning of stems, etc.,
are corrected. The <i>pitch names</i> may be dictated instead of
the syllables if desired, and still further practice may be
provided by asking that the exercise be transposed to other
keys.</p></div>

<h2><span class="smcap">Symbols of Music Defined</span></h2>


<p>12. A <i>staff</i> is a collection of parallel lines, together with the
spaces belonging to them. The modern staff has five lines and six
spaces, these being ordinarily referred to as first line, second line,
third line, fourth line, and fifth line (beginning with the lowest); and
space below (<i>i.e.</i>, space below the first line), first space, second
space, third space, fourth space, and space above.</p>

<p>The definition and discussion above refer more specifically to one of
the portions of the &quot;great staff,&quot; the latter term being often applied
to the combination of treble and bass staffs (with one leger line
between) so commonly used in piano music, etc.</p>

<p>13. The <i>extent of the staff</i> may be increased either above or below by
the addition of short lines called <i>leger lines</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and notes may be
written on either these lines or on the spaces above and below them.</p>

<p>14. The lines and spaces constituting the staff (including leger lines
if any) are often referred to as <i>staff degrees</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, each separate
line and space is considered to be &quot;a degree of the staff.&quot; The tones of
a scale are also sometimes referred to as &quot;degrees of the scale.&quot;</p>

<p>15. A <i>clef</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is a sign placed on the staff to designate what pitches
are to be represented by its lines and spaces. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, the G clef
shows us not only that the second line of the staff represents G, but
that the first line represents E, the first space F, etc. The F clef
similarly shows us that the fifth line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> of the bass staff represents the
first A below middle C, the fourth line the first F below middle C, etc.</p>

<p>The student should note that these clefs are merely modified forms of
the letters G and F, which (among others) were used to designate the
pitches represented by certain lines when staff notation was first
inaugurated. For a fuller discussion of this matter see
<span lang="el" title="Transcriber's Note: Corrected error Appendix I"><a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a></span>, <a href="#Page_101">p. 101</a>.</p>

<p>16. When the G clef is used the staff is usually referred to as the
<i>treble staff</i>, and when the F clef is used, as the <i>bass staff</i>. Such
expressions as &quot;singing from the treble clef,&quot; or &quot;singing in the treble
clef,&quot; and &quot;singing in the bass clef&quot; are still frequently heard, but
are preferably replaced by &quot;singing from the treble staff,&quot; and &quot;singing
from the bass staff.&quot; Fig. 6 shows the permanent names of lines and
spaces when the G and F clefs are used.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fig06.jpg" width="636" height="156" alt="Fig. 6" title="Fig. 6" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>17. <i>The movable C clef</i> <img src="images/cclef1.jpg" width="33" height="24" alt="C clef" title="C clef" /> or
<img src="images/cclef2.jpg" width="16" height="24" alt="C clef" title="C clef" />,
formerly in very common use, is now utilized for only two purposes,
viz., (1) in music written for certain orchestral instruments (cello,
viola, etc.) of extended range, in order to avoid having to use too many
leger lines; and (2) for indicating the tenor part in vocal music. This
latter usage seems also to be disappearing however, and the tenor part
is commonly written on the treble staff, it being understood that the
tones are to be sung an octave lower than the notes would indicate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The C clef as used in its various positions is shown in Figs. 7, 8, and
9. It will be noted that in each case the line on which the clef is
placed represents &quot;middle C.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p><a name="SEC_18">18.</a> A <i>sharp</i> is a character which causes the degree of the staff with
which it is associated to represent a pitch one half-step higher than it
otherwise would.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Thus in Fig. 10 (<i>a</i>) the fifth line and first space represent
the pitch F, but in Fig. 10 (<i>b</i>) these same staff degrees
represent an entirely different tone&#8212;F<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>. The student
should note that the sharp does not then <i>raise</i> anything; it
merely causes a staff degree to represent a higher tone than
it otherwise would. There is just as much difference between F
and F<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> as between B and C, and yet one would never think
of referring to C as &quot;B raised&quot;!</p></div>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fig10.jpg" width="200" height="99" alt="Fig. 10" title="Fig. 10" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>19. A <i>flat</i> is a character that causes the degree of the staff with
which it is associated to represent a tone one half-step lower than it
otherwise would. (See note under <a href="#SEC_18">Sec. 18</a> and apply the same discussion
here.)</p>

<p>20. A <i>double-sharp</i> causes the staff degree on which it is placed to
represent a pitch one whole-step higher than it would without any sharp.
Similarly, a double-flat causes the staff degree on which it is placed
to represent a pitch one whole-step lower than it would without any
flat.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Double-sharps and double-flats are generally used on staff
degrees that have already been sharped or flatted, therefore
their practical effect is to cause staff degrees to represent
pitches respectively a half-step higher and a half-step lower
than would be represented by those same degrees in their
diatonic condition. Thus in Fig. 10 (<i>b</i>) the first space in
its diatonic condition<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> represents F-sharp, and the
double-sharp on this degree would cause it to represent a
pitch one-half step higher than F-sharp, <i>i.e.</i>,
F-double-sharp.</p></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Symbols of Music Defined</span> (<i>Continued</i>)</h2>


<p>21. The <i>natural</i><a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> (sometimes called <i>cancel</i>) annuls the effect of
previous sharps, flats, double-sharps, and double-flats, within the
measure in which it occurs. After a double-sharp or double-flat the
combination of a natural with a sharp, or a natural with a flat is often
found: in this case only one sharp or flat is annulled. (Sometimes also
the single sharp or flat will be found by itself, cancelling the
double-sharp or double-flat). The natural is often used when a
composition changes key, as in Fig. 11, where a change from E to G is
shown.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fig11.jpg" width="150" height="82" alt="Fig. 11" title="Fig. 11" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>22. The group of sharps or flats (or absence of them) at the beginning
of a staff partially indicates the key in which the composition is
written. They are called collectively the <i>key-signature</i>.</p>

<p>23. The same key-signature may stand for either one of two keys, the
major key, or its relative minor, hence in order to determine in what
key a melody is one must note whether the tones are grouped about the
major tonic DO or the minor tonic LA. In a harmonized composition it is
almost always possible to determine the key by referring to the last
bass note; if the final chord is clearly the DO chord the composition is
in the major key, but if this final chord is clearly the LA chord then
it is almost certain that the entire composition is in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> minor key.
Thus if a final chord appears as that in Fig. 12 the composition is
clearly in G major, while if it appears as in Fig. 13, it is just as
surely in E minor.</p>

<p>24. Sharps, flats, naturals, double-sharps and double-flats, occurring
in the course of the composition (<i>i.e.</i>, after the key signature) are
called <i>accidentals</i>, whether they actually cause a staff degree to
represent a different pitch as in Fig. 14 or simply make clear a
notation about which there might otherwise be some doubt as in Fig. 15,
measure two. The effect of such accidentals terminates at the bar.</p>

<p>25. In the case of a <i>tie across a bar</i> an accidental remains in force
until the combined value of the tied notes expires. In Fig. 16 first
measure, third beat, an accidental sharp makes the third space represent
the pitch C sharp. By virtue of the tie across the bar the third space
continues to represent C sharp thru the first beat of the second
measure, but for the remainder of the measure the third space will
represent C unless the sharp is repeated as in Fig. 17.</p>

<p>26. The following rules for making staff degrees represent pitches
different from those of the diatonic scale will be found useful by the
beginner in the study of music notation. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> rules are quoted from
&quot;The Worcester Musical Manual,&quot; by Charles I. Rice.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
1. To sharp a natural degree, use a sharp. Fig. 18.<br />
2. To sharp a sharped degree, use a double sharp. Fig. 19.<br />
3. To sharp a flatted degree, use a natural. Fig. 20.<br />
4. To flat a natural degree, use a flat. Fig. 21.<br />
5. To flat a flatted degree, use a double flat. Fig. 22.<br />

<p><a name="SEC_27">27.</a> When two different notations represent the same pitch, the word
<i>enharmonic</i> is applied. Thus we may say that F sharp and G flat (on
keyboard instruments at least) are enharmonically the same.</p>

<p>This word <i>enharmonic</i> is used in such expressions as enharmonic change,
enharmonic keys, enharmonic interval, enharmonic modulation, enharmonic
relation, etc., and in all such combinations it has the same meaning,
viz.&#8212;a change in notation but no change in the pitch represented.</p>

<p>28. A <i>note</i> is a character expressing relative duration, which when
placed on a staff indicates that a certain tone is to be sounded for a
certain relative length of time. The pitch of the tone to be sounded is
shown by the position of the note on the staff, while the length of time
it is to be prolonged is shown by the shape of the note. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, a
half-note on the second line of the treble staff indicates that a
specific pitch (g') is to be played or sung for a period of time twice
as long as would be indicated by a quarter-note in the same composition.</p>

<p>29. A <i>rest</i> is a character which indicates a rhythmic silence of a
certain relative length.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

Quarter-note&#8212;crotchet.<br />

Sixteenth-note&#8212;semi-quaver.<br />
Thirty-second-note&#8212;demi-semi-quaver.<br />
</p></div>

<p>The corresponding rests are referred to by the same system of
nomenclature: <i>e.g.</i>, <i>semi-breve rest</i>, etc.</p>

<p>32. <i>Sixty-fourth</i> and <i>one-hundred-and-twenty-eighth-notes</i> are
occasionally found, but are not in common use. The <i>double-whole-note</i>
(<i>breve</i>), made <img src="images/breve1.jpg" width="43" height="24" alt="breve" title="breve" /> or
<img src="images/breve2.jpg" width="27" height="24" alt="breve" title="breve" />, is still used,
especially in English music, which frequently employs the half-note as
the beat-unit. Thus in four-half measure the breve would be necessary to
indicate a tone having four beats.</p>

<p>33. The <i>whole-rest</i> has a peculiarity of usage not common to any of the
other duration symbols, viz., that it is often employed as a
<i>measure-rest</i>, filling an entire measure of beats, no matter what the
measure-signature may be. Thus, not only in four-quarter-measure, but in
two-quarter, three-quarter, six-eighth, and other varieties, the
whole-rest fills the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> entire measure, having a value sometimes greater,
sometimes less than the corresponding whole-note. Because of this
peculiarity of usage the whole-rest is termed <i>Takt-pausa</i>
(measure-rest) by the Germans.</p>

<p>34. A <i>bar</i> is a vertical line across the staff, dividing it into
measures. The word <i>bar</i> is often used synonymously with <i>measure</i> by
orchestral conductors and others; thus, &quot;begin at the fourteenth bar
after J.&quot; This use of the word, although popular, is incorrect.</p>

<p>35. A <i>double-bar</i> consists of two vertical lines across the staff, at
least one of the two being a heavy line. The double bar marks the end of
a division, movement, or entire composition.</p>

<p>36. A <i>double bar</i> (or single heavy bar) with either two or four dots
indicates that a section is to be repeated. If the repeat marks occur at
only one point the entire preceding part is to be repeated, but if the
marks occur twice (the first time at the right of the bar but the second
time at the left), only the section thus enclosed by the marks is to be
repeated.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>37. Sometimes a different cadence (or ending) is to be used for the
repetition, and this is indicated as in Fig. 24.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>38. The Italian word <i>bis</i> is occasionally used to indicate that a
certain passage or section is to be repeated. This use is becoming
obsolete.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_39">39.</a> The words <i>da capo</i> (<i>D.C.</i>) mean literally &quot;from the head,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>,
repeat from the beginning. The words <i>dal segno</i> (<i>D.S.</i>) indicate a
repetition from the sign (<img src="images/segno1.jpg" width="21" height="20" alt="segno" title="segno" /> or
<img src="images/segno2.jpg" width="20" height="20" alt="segno" title="segno" />) instead of
from the beginning.</p>

<p>In the case of both <i>D.C.</i> and <i>D.S.</i> the word <i>fine</i> (meaning literally
<i>the end</i>) is ordinarily used to designate the point at which the
repeated section is to terminate. The fermata (<img src="images/fermata.jpg" width="30" height="17" alt="fermata" title="fermata" />) was
formerly in common use for this same purpose, but is seldom so employed
at present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>D.C.</i> (<i>sin</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>) <i>al fine</i> means&#8212;repeat from the beginning
to the word &quot;fine.&quot;</p>


<p><i>D.C. al</i>
<img src="images/fermata.jpg" width="30" height="17" alt="fermata" title="fermata" /> means&#8212;repeat to the fermata (or
hold).</p>

<p><i>D.C. senza <span lang="el" title="Transcriber's Note: Corrected misspelling repetitione">repetizione</span></i>, or <i>D.C. ma senza repetizione</i>,
both mean&#8212;repeat from the beginning, but without observing other
repeat marks during the repetition.</p>

<p><i>D.C. e poi la coda</i> means&#8212;repeat the first section only to
the mark <img src="images/coda.jpg" width="21" height="20" alt="coda" title="coda" />, then skip to the coda. (See <a href="#Page_74">p. 74</a>,
<a href="#SEC_157">Sec. 157</a>, for discussion of <i>coda</i>).</p></div>

<p>40. In certain cases where the repetition of characteristic figures can
be indicated without causing confusion, it is the practice of composers
(especially in orchestral music) to make use of certain <i>signs of
repetition</i>. Some of the commonest of these abbreviations are shown in
the following examples.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>41. The word <span lang="el" title="Transcriber's Note: Corrected error similie"><i>simile</i></span>
(sometimes <i>segue</i>) indicates that a certain effect previously begun is
to be continued, as <i>e.g.</i>, staccato playing, pedalling, style of bowing
in violin music, etc. The word <i>segue</i> is also occasionally used to show
that an accompaniment figure (especially in orchestral music) is to be
continued.</p>

<p>42. <i>When some part is to rest for two or more measures</i> several methods
of notation are possible. A rest of two measures is usually indicated
thus
<img src="images/2measrest.jpg" width="39" height="42" alt="2-measure rest" title="2-measure rest" />. Three measures thus
<img src="images/3measrest.jpg" width="61" height="42" alt="3-measure rest" title="3-measure rest" />. Four measures
thus
<img src="images/4measrest.jpg" width="37" height="42" alt="4-measure rest" title="4-measure rest" />. Rests of more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> four measures are usually
indicated in one of the following ways:
<img src="images/multimeasrest1.jpg" width="300" height="67" alt="multi-measure rest" title="multi-measure rest" />. Sometimes the
number of measures is written directly on the staff, thus;
<img src="images/multimeasrest2.jpg" width="100" height="42" alt="multi-measure rest" title="multi-measure rest" />.</p>

<p>43. The letters G.P. (general pause, or grosse pause), the words <i>lunga
pausa</i>, or simply the word <i>lunga</i>, are sometimes written over a rest to
show that there is to be a prolonged pause or rest in all parts. Such
expressions are found only in ensemble music, <i>i.e.</i>, music in which
several performers are engaged at the same time.</p>

<p>44. The <i>fermata</i> or <i>hold</i>
<img src="images/fermata.jpg" width="30" height="17" alt="fermata" title="fermata" /> over a note or chord
indicates that the tone is to be prolonged, the duration of the
prolongation depending upon the character of the music and the taste of
the performer or conductor. It has already been noted that the hold over
a bar was formerly used to designate the end of the composition, as the
word <i>fine</i> is employed at present, but this usage has practically
disappeared and the hold over the bar now usually indicates a short rest
between two sections of a composition.</p>

<p>45. The sign <i>8va......</i> (an abbreviation of <span lang="el" title="Transcriber's Note: Corrected error al ottava"><i>all'ottava</i></span>,
literally at the octave) above the staff, indicates that all tones are to be
sounded an octave higher than the notes would indicate. When found below
the staff the same sign serves to indicate that the tones are to be
sounded an octave lower. The term <i>8va bassa</i> has also this latter
signification.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_46">46.</a> Sometimes the word <i>loco</i> (in place) is used to show that the part
is no longer to be sounded an octave higher (or lower), but this is more
often indicated by the termination of the dotted (or wavy) line.</p>

<p>47. The sign <i>Col 8</i> (<span lang="el" title="Transcriber's Note: Corrected error col ottava"><i>coll'ottava</i></span>&#8212;with
the octave) shows that the
tones an octave higher or lower are to be sounded <i>with</i> the tones
indicated by the printed notes. </p>

<p>48. For the sake of definiteness in referring to pitches, a particular
name is applied to each octave, and all pitches in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> the octave are
referred to by means of a uniform nomenclature. The following figure
will make this system clear:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fig29.jpg" width="600" height="192" alt="Fig. 29" title="Fig. 29" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>Thus <i>e.g.</i>, &quot;great G&quot; (written simply G), is the G represented by the
first line of the bass staff. Small A (written a), is represented by the
fifth line of the bass staff. Two-lined G, (written
<img src="images/2lineg.jpg" width="12" height="24" alt="2-lined G" title="2-lined G" />),
is represented by the space above the fifth line, treble staff.
Three-lined C, (written
<img src="images/3linec.jpg" width="10" height="24" alt="3-lined C" title="3-lined C" />), is represented by the
second added line above the treble staff, etc. The <i>one-lined octave</i>
may be described as the octave from <i>middle C</i> to the B represented by
the third line of the treble staff, and any tone within that octave is
referred to as &quot;one-lined.&quot; Thus&#8212;<i>one-lined</i> D, <i>one-lined</i> G, etc.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In scientific works on acoustics, etc., the pitches in the sub
octave (or sub-contra octave as it is often called) are
referred to as C<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, E<sub>2</sub>, etc.; those in the contra
octave as C<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, etc.; in the great octave, as c<sup>1</sup>,
d<sup>1</sup>, etc.; in the small octave as c<sup>2</sup>, d<sup>2</sup>, etc.</p></div>

indicates that the tone is to be sounded and then instantly released.
<img src="images/staccato.jpg" width="150" height="50" alt="staccato" title="staccato" /> In music for organ and for some other instruments the
staccato note is sometimes interpreted differently, this depending on
the character of the instrument.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>On stringed instruments of the violin family the staccato
effect is usually secured by a long, rapid stroke of the bow
for each tone; in the case of harp and drum the hand is

stopping the tone instantly. On the organ the tone is often
prolonged to one-half the value of the printed note before the
keys are released.</p></div>

<p>53. <i>The wedge-shaped dash over the note</i> (staccatissimo) was formerly
employed to indicate a tone still more detached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> than that indicated by
the dot, but this sign is really superfluous, and is seldom used at
present. <img src="images/staccatissimo.jpg" width="150" height="50" alt="staccatissimo" title="staccatissimo" /></p>

<p>54. <i>A tie</i> is a curved line connecting the heads of two notes that call
for the same tone. It indicates that they are to be sounded as one tone
having a duration equal to the combined value of both notes. <i>E.g.</i>, a
half-note tied to a quarter-note would indicate a tone equal in
duration-length to that shown by a dotted half-note; two half-notes tied
would indicate a tone equal in duration to that shown by a whole-note.

<p>A. <i>To indicate legato</i> (sustained or connected) <i>tones</i>, as contrasted
with staccato (detached) ones.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In violin music this implies playing all tones thus slurred in
one bow; in music for the voice and for wind instruments it
implies singing or playing them in one breath.</p></div>

<p>B. <i>As a phrase-mark</i>, in the interpretation of which the first tone of
the phrase is often accented slightly, and the last one shortened in
value.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This interpretation of the phrase is especially common when
the phrase is short (as in the two-note phrase), and when the
tones constituting the phrase are of short duration, <i>e.g.</i>,
the phrase given in Fig. 32 would be played approximately as
written in Fig. 33.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>But if the notes are of greater value, especially in slow
tempi, the slur merely indicates legato, <i>i.e.</i>, sustained or
connected rendition. Fig. 34 illustrates such a case.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>This is a matter of such diverse usage that it is difficult to
generalize regarding it. The tendency seems at present to be
in the direction of using the slur (<i>in instrumental music</i>)
as a phrase-mark exclusively, it being understood that unless
there is some direction to the contrary, the tones are to be
performed in a connected manner.</p></div>

syllable of text. See Fig. 35.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In notes of small denomination (eighths and smaller) this same
thing is often indicated by <i>stroking</i> the stems together as
in Fig. 36. This can only be done in cases where the natural
grouping of notes in the measure will not be destroyed.</p></div>

<p>D. To mark special note-groups (triplets, etc.), in which case the slur
is accompanied by a figure indicating the number of notes in the group.
See Fig. 37 (<i>a</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The most common of these irregular note-groups is the
<i>triplet</i>, which consists of three notes to be performed in
the time ordinarily given to two of the same value. Sometimes
the triplet consists of only two notes as in Fig. 37 (<i>b</i>). In
such a case the first two of the three notes composing the
triplet are considered to be tied.</p></div>

<p>56. The <i>combination of slur or tie and dots</i> over the notes indicates
that the tones are to be somewhat detached, but not sharply so.
<img src="images/slurdots.jpg" width="189" height="50" alt="slur and dots" title="slur and dots" /></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This effect is sometimes erroneously termed <i>portamento</i> (lit.
<i>carrying</i>), but this term is more properly reserved for an
entirely different effect, <i>viz.</i>, when a singer, or player on
a stringed instrument, passes from a high tone to a low one
(or vice versa) touching lightly on some or all of the
diatonic tones between the two melody tones.</p></div>

<p>57. The horizontal <i>dash over a note</i>
<img src="images/dashnote.jpg" width="16" height="24" alt="dash over note" title="dash over note" /> indicates that the
tone is to be slightly accented, and sustained. This mark is also
sometimes used after a staccato passage to show that the tones are no
longer to be performed in detached fashion, but are to be sustained.
This latter use is especially common in music for stringed instruments.</p>

<p>58. The combination of <i>dash and dot over a note</i>
<img src="images/dashdot.jpg" width="16" height="28" alt="dash and dot over note" title="dash and dot over note" />
indicates that the tone is to be slightly accented and separated from
its neighboring tones.</p>

<p>59. <i>Accent marks</i> are made in a variety of fashions. The most common
forms follow. <img src="images/accents.jpg" width="38" height="12" alt="accents" title="accents" /> <i>sf</i>
<i>fz</i>. All indicate that a certain tone or chord is to be differentiated
from its neighboring tones or chords by receiving a certain relative
amount of stress.</p>

<p>60. In music for keyboard instruments it is sometimes necessary to
indicate that a certain part is to be played by a certain hand. The
abbreviations r.h. (right hand), m.d. (mano destra, It.), and m.d. (main
droite, Fr.), designate that a passage or tone is to be played with the
right hand, while l.h. (left hand), m.s. (mano sinistra, It.), and m.g.
(main gauche, Fr.), show that the left hand is to be employed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>61. <i>The wavy line placed vertically beside a chord</i>
<img src="images/arpeggio.jpg" width="65" height="50" alt="arpeggio" title="arpeggio" />
indicates that the tones are to be sounded consecutively instead of
simultaneously, beginning with the lowest tone, all tones being
sustained until the duration-value of the chord has expired. This is
called <i>arpeggio playing</i>. When the wavy line extends through the entire
chord (covering both staffs) as in Fig. 38, all the tones of the chord
are to be played one after another, beginning with the lowest: but if
there is a separate wavy line for each staff as at Fig. 39 then the
lowest tone represented on the upper staff is to be played
simultaneously with the lowest tone represented on the bass staff.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The word arpeggio (plural arpeggi) is a derivation of the
Italian word <i>arpa</i> (meaning harp), and from this word <i>arpa</i>
and its corresponding verb <i>arpeggiare</i> (to play on the harp)
are derived also a number of other terms commonly used in
instrumental music. Among these are&#8212;arpeggiamento,
arpeggiando, arpeggiato, etc., all of these terms referring to
a <i>harp style</i> of performance, the tones being sounded one
after another in rapid succession instead of simultaneously as
on the piano.</p></div>

<p>62. The sign
<img src="images/cresc-decresc.jpg" width="83" height="12" alt="crescendo-decrescendo" title="crescendo-decrescendo" /> over a note indicates that
the tone is to be begun softly, gradually increased in power, and as
gradually decreased again, ending as softly as it began. In vocal music
this effect is called <i>messa di voce</i>.</p>

<p>63. In music for stringed instruments of the violin family, the sign
<img src="images/downbow.jpg" width="11" height="12" alt="downbow" title="downbow" /> indicates down-bow and the sign
<img src="images/upbow.jpg" width="13" height="12" alt="upbow" title="upbow" />
up-bow. In cello music the down-bow sign is sometimes written

<h2><span class="smcap">Embellishments</span></h2>


<p>64. <i>Embellishments (or graces) (Fr. agr&#233;ments</i>) are ornamental tones,
either represented in full in the score or indicated by certain signs.
The following are the embellishments most commonly found: Trill (or
shake), mordent, inverted mordent (or prall trill), turn (gruppetto),
inverted turn, appoggiatura and acciaccatura.</p>

<p>Usage varies greatly in the interpretation of the signs representing
these embellishments and it is impossible to give examples of all the
different forms. The following definitions represent therefore only the
most commonly found examples and the most generally accepted
interpretations.</p>

<p>65. The <i>trill (or shake</i>) consists of the rapid alternation of two
tones to the full value of the printed note. The lower of these two
tones is represented by the printed note, while the upper one is the
next higher tone in the diatonic scale of the key in which the
composition is written. The interval between the two tones may therefore
be either a half-step or a whole-step.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Whether the trill is to begin with the principal tone
(represented by the printed note) or with the one above is a
matter of some dispute among theorists and performers, but it
may safely be said that the majority of modern writers on the
subject would have it begin on the principal tone rather than
on the tone above. Fig. 40.</p>

<p>When the principal note is preceded by a small note on the
degree above, it is of course understood that the trill begins
on the tone above. Fig. 41.</p></div>

<p>The trill is indicated by the sign
<img src="images/trill.jpg" width="113" height="12" alt="trill" title="trill" />.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="music/fig41.mid">[Listen]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>The above examples would be termed <i>perfect trills</i> because they close
with a turn. By inference, an <i>imperfect trill</i> is one closing without a
turn.</p>

<p>66. The <i>mordent</i>
<img src="images/mordent.jpg" width="21" height="12" alt="mordent" title="mordent" /> consists of three tones; first the
one represented by the printed note; second the one next below it in the
diatonic scale; third the one represented by the printed note again.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="music/fig42.mid">[Listen]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>67. The <i>double (or long) mordent</i> has five tones (sometimes seven)
instead of three, the first two of the three tones of the regular
mordent being repeated once or more. (See Fig. 43.)</p>

<p>In the case of both mordent and double-mordent the tones are sounded as
quickly as possible, the time taken by the embellishment being
subtracted from the value of the principal note as printed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>68. The <i>inverted mordent</i>
<img src="images/invmordent.jpg" width="25" height="12" alt="inverted mordent" title="inverted mordent" /> (note the absence
of the vertical line) is like the mordent except that the tone below is
replaced by the tone above in each case. This ornament is sometimes
called a &quot;transient shake&quot; because it is really only a part of the more
elaborate grace called &quot;trill.&quot; (See Fig. 44.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The confusion at present attending the interpretation of the
last two embellishments described, might be largely obviated
if the suggestion of a recent writer<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> to call the one the
<i>upward mordent</i>, and the other the <i>downward mordent</i> were to
be universally adopted.</p></div>

<p>69. The <i>turn</i> consists of four tones; first, the diatonic scale-tone
above the principal tone; second, the principal tone itself; third, the
tone below the principal tone; and fourth, the principal tone again.</p>

<p>When the sign (<img src="images/turn1.jpg" width="22" height="10" alt="turn" title="turn" /> or
<img src="images/turn2.jpg" width="23" height="12" alt="turn" title="turn" />) occurs over a note
of small value in rapid tempo (Fig. 45) the turn consists of four tones
of equal value; but if it occurs over a note of greater value, or in a
slow tempo, the tones are usually played quickly (like the mordent), and
the fourth tone is then held until the time-value of the note has
expired. (Fig. 46.)</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="music/fig45-46.mid">[Listen]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>70. <i>When the turn-sign is placed a little to the right of the note</i> the
principal tone is sounded first and held to almost its full time-value,
then the turn is played just before the next tone of the melody. In this
case the four tones are of equal length as in the first example. (See
Fig. 47.)</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The student should note the difference between these two
effects; in the case of a turn <i>over</i> the note the turn comes
at the beginning, but in the case of the sign <i>after</i> the note
the turn comes at the very end. But in both cases the time
taken by the embel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>lishment is taken from the time-value of
the principal note. For further details see Grove's Dictionary
of Music and Musicians, Vol. V, p. 184. Also Elson, op. cit.
p. 274.</p></div>

<p>71. Sometimes an accidental occurs with the turn, and in this case when
written above the sign it refers to the highest tone of the turn, but
when written below, to the lowest (Fig. 48).</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>72. In the <i>inverted turn</i> the order of tones is reversed, the lowest
one coming first, the principal tone next, the highest tone third, and
the principal tone again, last.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>73. The <i>appoggiatura</i> (lit. <i>leaning note</i>) consists of an ornamental
tone introduced before a tone of a melody, thus delaying the melody tone
until the ornamental tone has been heard. The time taken for this
ornamental tone is taken from that of the melody tone.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The appoggiatura was formerly classified into <i>long
appoggiatura</i> and <i>short appoggiatura</i>, but modern writers
seem to consider the term &quot;short appoggiatura&quot; to be
synonymous with acciaccatura<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, and to avoid confusion the
word <i>acciaccatura</i> will be used in this sense, and defined
under its own heading.</p></div>

<p>74. Three rules for the interpretation of the appoggiatura are commonly
cited, viz.:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) When it is possible to divide the principal tone into
halves, then the appoggiatura receives one-half the value of
the printed note. (Fig. 50.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) When the principal note is dotted (division into halves
being therefore not possible), the appoggiatura receives
two-thirds of the value. (Fig. 51.)</p>

<p>(3) When the principal note is tied to a note of smaller
denomination the appoggiatura receives the value of the first
of the two notes. (Fig. 52.)</p></div>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fig50-52.jpg" width="600" height="185" alt="Figs. 50-52" title="Figs. 50-52" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="music/fig50-52.mid">[Listen]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>75. The <i>acciaccatura</i> (or short appoggiatura) is written like the
appoggiatura except that it has a light stroke across its stem.
<img src="images/acciaccatura.jpg" width="86" height="50" alt="acciaccatura" title="acciaccatura" /> It has no definite duration-value, but is sounded as
quickly as possible, taking its time from that of the principal tone.
The appoggiatura is always accented, but the acciaccatura never is, the
stress always falling on the melody tone. (See Grove, op. cit. Vol. I,
p. 96.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The use of embellishments is on the wane, and the student of
to-day needs the above information only to aid him in the
interpretation of music written in previous centuries. In the
early days of instrumental music it was necessary to introduce
graces of all sorts because the instruments in use were not
capable of sustaining tone for any length of time; but with
the advent of the modern piano with its comparatively great
sustaining power, and also with the advent in vocal music of a
new style of singing (German Lieder singing as contrasted with
Italian coloratura singing), ornamental tones were used less
and less, and when found now are usually written out in full
in the score instead of being indicated by signs.</p></div>

<h2><span class="smcap">Scales</span></h2>


<p>76. A <i>scale</i> (from <i>scala</i>, a Latin word meaning <i>ladder</i>; Ger.
<i>Ton-leiter</i>) is an ascending or descending series of tones, progressing
according to some definite system, and all bearing (in the case of
tonality scales at least) a very intimate relation to the first
tone&#8212;the <i>key-tone</i> or <i>tonic</i>. (See <a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>,
<a href="#SEC_78">Sec. 78</a>; also note 1 at
bottom of<a href="#Page_38"> p. 38</a>.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Many different kinds of scales have existed in various musical
eras, the point of resemblance among them all being the fact
that they have all more or less recognized the <i>octave</i> as the
natural limit of the series. The difference among the various
scales has been in the selection of intervals between the
scale-tones, and, consequently, in the number of tones within
the octave. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, in our major scale the intervals
between the tones are all whole-steps except two (which are
half-steps), and the result is a scale of <i>eight</i> tones
(including in this number both the key-tone and its octave):
but in the so-called <i>pentatonic</i> scale of the Chinese and
other older civilizations we find larger intervals (<i>e.g.</i>,
the step-and-a-half), and consequently a smaller number of
tones within the octave. Thus in the scale upon which many of
the older Scotch folk songs are based the intervals are
arranged as follows:</p></div>

<td style="font-size: 150%">5</td>
<td>step-and-<br />a-half</td>
<td style="font-size: 150%">6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The result is a scale of six tones, corresponding
approximately with C&#8212;D&#8212;E&#8212;G&#8212;A&#8212;C in our modern system.</p>

<p>The term <i>pentatonic</i> is thus seen to be a misnomer since the
sixth tone is necessary for the completion of the series, just
as the eighth tone is essential in our diatonic scales.</p>

<p>The following Chinese tune (called &quot;Jasmine&quot;) is based on the
pentatonic scale.</p></div>

<p>77. In studying the theory of the scale the student should bear in mind
the fact that a scale is not an arbitrary series of tones which some one
has invented, and which others are required to make use of. It is rather
the result of accustoming the ear to certain melodic combinations (which
were originally hit upon by accident), and finally analyzing and
systematizing these combinations into a certain definite order or
arrangement. The application of this idea may be verified when it is
recalled that most primitive peoples have invented melodies of some
sort, but that only in modern times, and particularly since the
development of instrumental music, have these melodies been analyzed,
and the scale upon which they have been based, discovered, the inventors
of the melodies being themselves wholly ignorant of the existence of
such scales.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_78">78.</a> A <i>key</i> is a number of tones grouping themselves naturally (both
melodically and harmonically) about a central tone&#8212;the key tone. The
word <i>tonality</i> is often used synonymously with <i>key</i> in this sense.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The difference between <i>key</i> and <i>scale</i> is therefore this,
that while both <i>key</i> and <i>scale</i> employ the same tone
material, by <i>key</i> we mean the material in general, without
any particular order or arrangement in mind, while by <i>scale</i>
we mean the same tones, but now arranged into a regular
ascending or descending series. It should be noted in this
connection also that not all scales present an equally good
opportunity of having their tones used as a basis for tonality
or key-feeling: neither the chromatic nor the whole-step scale
possess the necessary characteristics for being used as
tonality scales in the same sense that our major and minor
scales are so used.</p></div>

<p><a name="SEC_79">79.</a> There are <i>three general classes of scales</i> extant at the present
time, viz.: (1) Diatonic; (2) Chromatic; (3) Whole-tone.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>80. The word <i>diatonic</i> means &quot;through the tones&quot; (<i>i.e.</i>, through the
tones of the key), and is applied to both major and minor scales of our
modern tonality system. In general a diatonic scale may be defined as
one which proceeds by half-steps and whole-steps. There is, however, one
exception to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> this principle, viz., in the progression six to seven in
the harmonic minor scale, which is of course a step-and-a-half. (See <a href="#Page_33">p. 33</a>,
<a href="#SEC_86">Sec. 86</a>.)</p>

<p>81. A <i>major diatonic scale</i> is one in which the intervals between the
tones are arranged as follows:</p>

<p>In other words, a major diatonic scale is one in which the intervals
between three and four, and between seven and eight are half-steps, all
the others being whole-steps. A composition based on this scale is said
to be written in the major mode, or in a major key. The major diatonic
scale may begin on any one of the twelve pitches C, C<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> or D<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>,
D, D<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> or E<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, E, F, F<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> or G<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, G, G<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> or
A<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, A, A<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> or B<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, B, but in each case it is the same
scale because the intervals between its tones are the same. We have then
one major scale only, but this scale may be written in many different
positions, and may be sung or played beginning on any one of a number of
different pitches.</p>

<p>82. It is interesting to note that the major scale consists of two
identical series of four tones each; <i>i.e.</i>, the first four tones of the
scale are separated from one another by exactly the same intervals and
these intervals appear in exactly the same order as in the case of the
last four tones of the scale. Fig. 53 will make this clear. The first
four tones of any diatonic scale (major or minor) are often referred to
as the <i>lower tetrachord</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and the upper four tones as the <i>upper
tetrachord</i>.</p>

<p>It is interesting further to note that the upper tetrachord of any
<i>sharp</i> scale is always used without change as the lower tetrachord of
the next major scale involving sharps, while the lower tetrachord of any
<i>flat</i> scale is used as the upper tetrachord of the next flat scale. See

<p>83. From the standpoint of staff notation the major scale may be written
in fifteen different positions, as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be observed that in the above series of scales those beginning
on F<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> and G<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> call for the same keys on the piano, <i>i.e.</i>,
while the notation is different, the actual tones of the scale are the
same. The scales of C<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> and D<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> likewise employ the same tones.
When two scales thus employ the same tones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> but differ in notation they
are said to be <i>enharmonic</i>, (cf. <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>,

<p>84. The <i>minor diatonic scale</i> is used in several slightly different
forms, but the characteristic interval between the first and third tones
(which differentiates it from the major scale) remains the same in every
case. This interval between the first and third tones consists of four
half-steps in the major scale and of three half-steps in the minor scale
and this difference in size has given rise to the designation <i>major</i>
for the scale having the larger third, and <i>minor</i> for the scale having
the smaller one.</p>

<p>85. <i>The original (or primitive) form</i> of the minor scale has its tones
arranged as follows.</p>

<p>As its name implies, this is the oldest of the three forms (being
derived from the old Greek Aeolian scale), but because of the absence of
a &quot;leading tone&quot; it is suitable for the simplest one-part music only,
and is therefore little used at present.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_86">86.</a> <i>The harmonic minor scale</i> is like the primitive form except that it
substitutes a tone one half-step higher for the seventh tone of the
older (<i>i.e.</i>, the primitive) form. This change was made because the
development of writing music in several parts (particularly <i>harmonic</i>
part-writing) made necessary a &quot;leading tone,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, a tone with a
strong tendency to move on up to the key-tone as a closing point. In
order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> to secure a tone with such a strongly upward tendency the
interval between <i>seven</i> and <i>eight</i> had to be reduced in size to a
half-step. It should be noted that this change in the seventh tone of
the scale caused an interval of a step-and-a-half between the sixth and
seventh tones of the scale.</p>

than six as well as one a half-step higher than seven, but this change
is made in the ascending scale only, the descending scale being like the
primitive form. The higher sixth (commonly referred to as the &quot;raised
sixth&quot;) was used to get rid of the unmelodic interval of a
step-and-a-half<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> (augmented second), while the return to the

vocal music, the harmonic form being in almost universal use in spite of
the augmented second.</p>

<p>88. The minor scale in its various positions (up to five sharps and five
flats) and in all three forms follows: a composition based on any one of
these forms (or upon a mixture of them, which often occurs) is said to
be <i>in the minor mode</i>. It will be noted that the first four tones are
alike in all three forms; <i>i.e.</i>, the lower tetrachord in the minor
scale is invariable no matter, what may happen to the upper tetrachord.

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Note.</i>&#8212;The student is advised to recite the <i>harmonic form</i>
of the minor scale as was suggested in the case of the major
scale, noting that the &quot;raised seventh&quot; does not affect the

E<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, d of F, etc., the small letter being used to refer to the minor
key or scale, while the capital letter indicates the major key or scale
unless accompanied by the word <i>minor</i>. Relative keys are therefore
defined as those having the same signature. G and e are relative keys,
as are also A and f<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>, etc.</p>

<p>90. A minor scale beginning with the same tone as a major scale is
referred to as its <i>tonic minor</i>. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, c with three flats in
its signature is the tonic minor of C with all degrees in natural
condition; e with one sharp is the tonic minor of E with four sharps,
etc. Tonic keys are therefore those having the same key-tone.</p>

<p>91. The eight tones of the diatonic scale (both major and minor) are
often referred to by specific names, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. <i>Tonic</i>&#8212;the tone. (This refers to the fact that the tonic
is the principal tone, or generating tone of the key, <i>i.e.</i>,
it is <i>the</i> tone.)</p>

<p>2. <i>Super-tonic</i>&#8212;above the tone.</p>

<p>3. <i>Mediant</i>&#8212;midway between tonic and dominant.</p>

<p>4. <i>Sub-dominant</i>&#8212;the under dominant. (This name does not
refer to the position of the tone under the dominant but to
the fact that the fifth below the tonic is also a dominant
tone&#8212;the under dominant&#8212;just as the fifth above is the upper
dominant).</p>

<p>5. <i>Dominant</i>&#8212;the governing tone. (From the Latin word
<i>dominus</i> meaning <i>master</i>.)</p>

<p>6. <i>Super-dominant</i>&#8212;above the dominant. Or
<i>Sub-mediant</i>&#8212;midway between tonic and sub-dominant.</p>

<p>7. <i>Leading tone</i>&#8212;the tone which demands resolution to the
tonic (one-half step above it).</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is interesting to study the changes in both spelling and
pronunciation that have occurred (and are still occurring) in
these syllables. The first one (ut) was changed to <i>DO</i> as
early as the sixteenth century because of the difficulty of
producing a good singing tone on <i>ut</i>. For the same reason and
also in order to avoid having two diatonic syllables with the
same initial letter, the tonic-sol-fa system (invented in
England about 1812 and systematized about 1850) changed SI to
TI and this change has been almost universally adopted by
teachers of sight-singing in this country. The more elaborate
tonic-sol-fa spelling of the diatonic syllables (DOH, LAH,
etc.), has not, however, been favorably received in this
country and the tendency seems to be toward still further
simplification rather than toward elaboration. It is probable
that further changes in both spelling and pronunciation will
be made in the near future, one such change that seems
especially desirable being some other syllable than RE for the
second tone of the major scale, so that the present syllable
may be reserved for &quot;flat-two,&quot; thus providing a uniform
vowel-sound for all intermediate tones of the descending
chromatic scale, as is already the case in the ascending form.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

half-steps. Its intervals are therefore always equal no matter with what
tone it begins. Since, however, we have (from the standpoint of the
piano keyboard) five pairs of tones<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> which are enharmonically the
same, it may readily be seen that the chromatic scale might be notated
in all sorts of fashions, and this is in fact the real status of the
matter, there being no one method uniformly agreed upon by composers.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Parry (Grove's Dictionary, article <i>chromatic</i>) recommends
writing the scale with such accidentals as can occur in
chromatic chords without changing the key in which the passage
occurs. Thus, taking C as a type, &quot;the first accidental will
be D<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, as the upper note of the minor ninth on the tonic;
the next will be E<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, the minor third of the key; the next
F<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>, the major third of the super-tonic&#8212;all of which can
occur without causing modulation&#8212;and the remaining two will
be A<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> and B<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, the minor sixth and seventh of the
key.&quot; According to this plan the chromatic scale beginning
with C would be spelled&#8212;C, D<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, D, E<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, E, F,
F<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>, G, A<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, A, B<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, B, C&#8212;the form being the
same both ascending and descending. This is of course written
exclusively from a harmonic standpoint and the advantage of
such a form is its definiteness.</p></div>

<p>94. For <i>sight-singing purposes</i> the chromatic scale<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> is usually
written by representing the intermediate tones in ascending by sharps,
(in some cases naturals and double-sharps), and the intermediate tones
in descending by flats (sometimes naturals and double-flats). The
chromatic scale in nine different positions, written from this
standpoint, follows, and the syllables most commonly applied in
sight-singing have also been added. In the first two scales the student
of harmony is asked to note that because of the very common prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>tice of
modulating to the dominant and sub-dominant keys, the intermediate tones
<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>4 and <span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>7 are quite universally used in both ascending and
descending melody passages. In other words the scales that follow would
more nearly represent actual usage if in each case <span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>4 (FI) were
substituted for <span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>5 (SE) in the descending scale; and if <span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>7

<a href="#SEC_79">Sec. 79</a>) is, as
its name implies, a scale in which the intervals between the tones
consist in every instance of whole-steps. This reduces the number of
tones in the scale to seven. Beginning with C the scale reads: C, D, E,
F<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> or G<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, A<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, B<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, C. This scale has been used
somewhat extensively by the ultramodern French school of composition
represented by Debussy, Ravel, and others, but is not making any
progress toward universal adoption. The remarks of a recent English
writer<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> on this subject may be interesting to the student who is
puzzled by the apparent present-day tendencies of French music. He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The student of some interesting modern developments will also
speedily discover that the adoption of the so-called
whole-tone scale as a basis of music is, except upon a keyed
instrument tuned to the compromise of equal temperament,
unnatural and impossible. No player upon a stringed instrument
can play the scale of whole-tones and arrive at an octave
which is in tune with the starting note, unless he
deliberately changes one of the notes on the road and alters
it while playing it. The obvious result of the application of
the whole-tone scale to an orchestra or a string quartet would
be to force them to adopt the equal temperament of the
pianoforte, and play every interval except the octave out of
tune. When this modification had taken hold all music in the
pure scale would be distorted and destroyed, unless string
players were to face the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> practically impossible drudgery of
studying both the equal temperament and the pure scale from
the start, and were able to tackle either form at a moment's
notice. A thorough knowledge of the natural genesis of the
scale of western nations will be the best antidote to fads
founded upon ignorance of it. It is a curious commentary upon
this question that Wagner, in the opening of the third act of
<i>Tristan</i> (bars 6 to 10), experimented with the whole-tone
scale and drew his pen through it, as was to be expected from
a composer whose every work proves the writer to have had the
pure scale inbred in him.&quot;</p></div>

<p>There may be some difference of opinion among acousticians as to whether
Mr. Stanford is correct in his scientific assumptions regarding the
difference between &quot;tempered&quot; and &quot;pure&quot; scales,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> but even so, there
is a far more potent reason why the whole-step scale will probably never
become popular as the major and minor scales now are, viz., the fact
that it offers no possibility of <i>inculcating tonality feeling</i>, which
has always been the basis of even the simplest primitive music. Tonality
scales give rise to a feeling of alternate periods of contraction and
relaxation&#8212;an active tone (or chord) followed by a passive one, but no
such effect is possible in the whole-step scale, and it seems suitable
therefore only for that class of music whose outlines are <i>purposely
intended to be</i> vague and indefinite&#8212;the impressionistic style of music
writing.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Measure</span></h2>


<p><a name="SEC_97">97.</a> From the standpoint of the eye, a <i>measure</i> is that portion of the
staff found between two bars, (in certain cases this space may be less
than a measure, as <i>e.g.</i>, at the beginning and end of a movement); but
from the standpoint of the ear a single, isolated measure is not
possible, and the term must therefore be defined in the plural form.</p>

<p><i>Measures</i> are similarly accented groups of evenly-spaced beats, each
group having at least one accented and one non-accented beat. The
strongest accent falls normally on the first beat in the measure.</p>

<p>Two essential characteristics are involved in the ordinary musical
measure:</p>

<p>(1) A group of even beats (or pulses), always felt, though not always
actually sounded, one or more of these beats being stronger than the
rest;</p>

<p>(2) Certain rhythmic figures (<img src="images/rhythm.jpg" width="207" height="50" alt="rhythmic figure" title="rhythmic figure" /> etc.) which form the
actual musical content of these groups.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The student will note the essential difference between rhythm
and measure. Rhythm is the regular recurrence of accent in a
series of beats (or pulses), while measure is the grouping of
these beats according to some specified system. In listening
to a piece of music, two hearers A and B may feel the <i>rhythm</i>
equally strongly, but A may subjectively group the beats
into&#8212;<i>one</i>, two | <i>one</i>, two |&#8212;etc., while B feels the
groups as&#8212;<i>one</i>, two, <i>three</i>, four | <i>one</i>, two, <i>three</i>,
four |&#8212;etc. Rhythm is thus seen to be a fundamental thing,
inherent in the music itself, while measure is to a certain
extent at least an arbitrary grouping which musicians have
adopted for practical purposes.</p></div>

<p>98. In <i>syncopation</i> the normal system of accenting is temporarily
suspended and the accented tone falls on the regularly unaccented part
of the measure. Syncopation may therefore be defined as the temporary
interruption of a normal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> series of accents, <i>i.e.</i>, accenting a beat
that is usually not accented. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, in Fig. 56, measure <i>one</i> has
the regular system of accents normally found in four-quarter-measure,
(strong accent on one, secondary accent on three); but measure <i>three</i>
has only one accent, and it falls on the second beat.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p><a name="SEC_99">99.</a> Measures are usually classified as <i>simple</i> and <i>compound</i>. A
<i>simple measure</i> is one which has but a single accent, <i>i.e.</i>, the
measure cannot be divided into smaller constituent groups. There are two
main classes of simple measures, two-beat measure, and three-beat
measure. A <i>compound measure</i> is (as its name implies) one made up by
combining two or more simple measures, or by the elaboration of a single
measure (in slow tempo) into several constituent groups. The principal
compound measures are four-beat and six-beat, both being referred to as
compound-duple measures. Five-beat, seven-beat, nine-beat, and
twelve-beat measures are also classified as compound measures.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>An English writer<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> classifies measures as duple, triple, or
quadruple, specifying that a simple measure is one in which
each beat is represented by a note whose value can be divided
into halves (<img src="images/simpmeas.jpg" width="203" height="30" alt="simple measure" title="simple measure" /> etc.) and that a compound measure
is one in which each beat is represented by a dotted-note,
whose value can be divided into three parts, (<img src="images/compmeas.jpg" width="257" height="30" alt="compound measure" title="compound measure" />).
There is thus seen to be considerable difference of opinion as
to the meaning of the words <i>simple</i> and <i>compound</i> when
applied in this connection, the principal question at issue
being whether four-beat measure is an individual variety, or
whether it is a variety compounded out of two-beat measures,
either by placing two of these in a group or by the
elaboration of a single measure into a larger number of beats,
as is often necessary in slow tempi. Perhaps the easiest way
out of the difficulty is to admit that both may be true&#8212;but
in different compositions. That is, it is frequently
impossible to tell whether a composition that is being
listened to is in two-beat, or in four-beat measure; and yet
it <i>is</i> sometimes possible so to discriminate. Since, however,
one cannot in the majority of cases distinguish between
two-beat and four-beat measures, it will probably be best to
leave the original classification intact and regard four-beat
measure as a compound variety.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>
<p>100. The <i>commonest varieties of measure</i> are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. <i>Duple</i> (sometimes called even measure, or even time), in
which there are two beats, the first one being accented.
Examples of duple measure are 2/4, 2/8, 2/2, two-quarter,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
two-eighth, and two-half measure, respectively.</p>


<p>2. <i>Triple</i>, (the old perfect measure), in which there are
three beats, the first one being accented, the second and
third unaccented. Examples are 3/8, 3/4, 3/2, three-eighth,
three-quarter, and three-half measure, respectively.</p>

<p>3. <i>Quadruple</i>, in which there are four beats, the first and
third being accented (primary accent on <i>one</i>, secondary
accent on <i>three</i>), the second and fourth unaccented. (See
note above, under <a href="#SEC_99">Sec. 99</a>.)</p>

<p>4. <i>Sextuple</i>, in which there are six beats, the first and
fourth being accented, the others not. In rapid tempi this is
always taken as compound duple measure, a dotted quarter note
having a beat. It will be noted that the two measures
<img src="images/sextuple.jpg" width="229" height="35" alt="sextuple" title="sextuple" /> are identical in effect with
<img src="images/sextuple2.jpg" width="224" height="50" alt="sextuple" title="sextuple" />.</p></div>

<p>101. Other varieties of measure sometimes found are 9/8 and 12/8, but
these are practically always taken as three-beat and four-beat measures
respectively, being equivalent to these if each group of three tones is
thought of as a triplet.
<img src="images/98bar.jpg" width="173" height="39" alt="9/8 bar" title="9/8 bar" /> is identical in effect with
<img src="images/34bar.jpg" width="165" height="50" alt="3/4 bar" title="3/4 bar" />.</p>

<p>102. <i>Quintuple</i> (five-beat) and <i>septuple</i> (seven-beat) measures are
occasionally met with, but these are rare and will always be sporadic.
The five-beat measure is taken as a combination of three and two, or of
two and three (sometimes a mixture of both in the same composition),
while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> seven-beat measure is taken in groups of four and three, or
of three and four.</p>

<p>103. The sign <img src="images/common.jpg" width="22" height="24" alt="common time" title="common time" /> is usually understood to mean
four-quarter measure, and the sign
<img src="images/cuttime.jpg" width="20" height="29" alt="cut-time" title="cut-time" />, two-half measure,
but usage varies somewhat, and the second sign is sometimes used to
indicate four-half measure. It may safely be said however that the sign
<img src="images/cuttime.jpg" width="20" height="29" alt="cut-time" title="cut-time" /> always indicates
that a half-note has a beat. <img src="images/cuttime.jpg" width="20" height="29" alt="cut-time" title="cut-time" /><img src="images/cuttime.jpg" width="20" height="29" alt="cut-time" title="cut-time" /> may occasionally be found indicating four-half measure
but this is rare.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The student will note that the sign
  <img src="images/common.jpg" width="22" height="24" alt="common time" title="common time" /> is
not a <i>letter</i> C, but an incomplete circle, differentiating
two-beat (imperfect) measure from three-beat (perfect)
measure. See <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A</a>, p.

<p>104. The word <i>time</i> in musical nomenclature has been greatly abused,
having been used to indicate:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) Rhythm; as &quot;the time was wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>(2) Variety of measure-signature; as &quot;two-four time.&quot;</p>

<p>(3) Rate of speed; as &quot;the time was too slow.&quot;</p></div>

<p>To obviate the confusion naturally resulting from this three-fold and
inexact use of the word, many teachers of music are adopting certain
<i>changes in terminology</i> as noted in Sections <a href="#SEC_105">105</a>,
<a href="#SEC_106">106</a>, and <a href="#SEC_107">107</a>. Such
changes may cause some confusion at first, but seem to be necessary if
our musical terminology is to be at all exact.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_105">105.</a> The <i>first of the changes</i> mentioned in the above paragraph is to
substitute the word <i>rhythm</i> for the word <i>time</i> when correcting
mistakes involving misplaced accent, etc. <i>E.g.</i>, &quot;Your <i>rhythm</i> in the
third measure of the lower score was wrong,&quot; instead of &quot;Your
<i>time</i>&#8212;was wrong.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="SEC_106">106.</a> The <i>second change</i> mentioned would eliminate such blind and
misleading expressions as &quot;two-four time,&quot; &quot;three-four time,&quot; &quot;four-four
time,&quot; &quot;six-eight time,&quot; etc., and substitute therefor such
self-explanatory designations as &quot;two-quarter measure,&quot; &quot;three-quarter
measure,&quot; &quot;four-quarter measure,&quot; &quot;six-eighth measure,&quot; etc. <i>E.g.</i>,
&quot;The first movement of the Beethoven Sonata Op. 2, No. 3, is in
<i>four-quarter measure</i>.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="SEC_107">107.</a> The <i>third change</i> referred to above would substitute the word
<i>tempo</i> (plural&#8212;<i>tempi</i>) for the word <i>time</i> in all allusions to rate
of speed. <i>E.g.</i>, &quot;The scherzo was played in very rapid <i>tempo</i>.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The word <i>tempo</i> has been used in this connection so long by
professional musicians that there can be no possible objection
to it on the ground of its being a foreign word. In fact there
is a decided advantage in having a word that is understood in
all countries where modern music (<i>i.e.</i>, civilized music) is
performed, and just here is found the principal reason for the
popularity of the Italian language in musical terminology.
Schumann, MacDowell and other well known composers have tried
to break down this popularity by using their own respective
vernaculars in both tempo and dynamic indications, but in
spite of these attempts the Italian language is still quite
universally used for this purpose, and deservedly so, for if
we are to have a <i>music notation</i> that is universal, so that
an American is able to play music written by a Frenchman or a
German, or a Russian, then we ought also to have a certain
number of expressions referring to tempo, etc., which will be
understood by all, <i>i.e.</i>, a music terminology that is
universal. The Italian language was the first in the field, is
the most universally known in this particular at the present
time, and is entirely adequate. It should therefore be
retained in use as a sort of musical Esperanto.</p></div>

<p>108. There are several <i>ways of finding the correct tempo</i> of a
composition:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. From the metronomic indication found at the beginning of
many compositions. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, the mark M.M. 92 (Maelzel's
Metronome 92) means that if the metronome (either Maelzel's or
some other reliable make) is set with the sliding weight at
the figure 92 there will be 92 clicks per minute, and they
will serve to indicate to the player or singer the rate at
which the beats (or pulses) should follow one another. This is
undoubtedly the most accurate means of determining tempi in
spite of slight inaccuracies in metronomes<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and of the
mistakes which composers themselves often make in giving
metronomic indications.</p>


<p>2. Another means of determining the tempo of a composition is
to play it at different tempi and then to choose the one that
&quot;feels right&quot; for that particular piece of music. This is
perhaps the best means of getting at the correct tempo but is
open only to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> musician of long experience, sure judgment,
and sound scholarship.</p>

<p>3. A third method of finding tempi is through the
interpretation of certain words used quite universally by
composers to indicate the approximate rate of speed and the
general mood of compositions. The difficulty with this method
is that one can hardly find two composers who employ the same
word to indicate the same tempo, so that no absolute rate of
speed can be indicated, and in the last analysis the conductor
or performer must fall back on the second method cited
above&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, individual judgment.</p></div>

<p><a name="SEC_109">109.</a> In spite of the inexactness of use in the case of expressions
relating to tempo, these expressions are nevertheless extremely useful
in giving at least a hint of what was in the composer's mind as he
conceived the music that we are trying to interpret. Since a number of
the terms overlap in meaning, and since the meaning of no single term is
absolute, these expressions relating to tempo are best studied in
groups. Perhaps the most convenient grouping is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. <i>Grave</i> (lit. weighty, serious), <i>larghissimo</i>,
<i>adagissimo</i>, and <i>lentissimo</i>&#8212;indicating the very slowest
tempo used in rendering music.</p>

<p>3. <i>Larghetto</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>a little largo</i>) and <i>adagietto</i> (<i>a

and <i>andantino</i>&#8212;indicating a moderately slow tempo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Andantino</i> is now quite universally taken slightly faster
than <i>andante</i>, in spite of the fact that if <i>andante</i> means
&quot;going,&quot; and if &quot;<i>ino</i>&quot; is the diminutive ending, then
<i>andantino</i> means &quot;going less,&quot; <i>i.e.</i>, more slowly!</p>

<i>allegretto</i> being usually interpreted as meaning a tempo
somewhat slower than <i>allegro</i>.</p>


<p>The word <i>allegro</i> means literally happy, joyous, and this
literal meaning is still <i>sometimes</i> applicable, but in the
majority of instances the term refers only to rate of speed.</p>

<p>111. There are certain <i>terms which indicate a modification of the
normal tempo</i> of a movement, these being divided into two classes, (a)
those terms which indicate in general a slower tempo, and (b) those
which indicate in general a more rapid tempo. The further subdivisions
of these two classes are shown below.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Terms indicating a slower tempo.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Terms indicating a <i>gradual</i> retard.</p>

<p><i>Ritenente</i>, (<i>rit.</i>), <i>ritenuto</i> (<i>rit.</i>), <i>ritardando</i>
(<i>rit.</i>), <i>rallentando</i> (<i>rall.</i>), <i>slentando</i>.</p>

<p>2. Terms indicating a tempo which is to become definitely
slower <i>at once</i>.</p>

<p><i>Pi&#249; lento</i> (lit. more slowly), <i>meno mosso</i> (lit. less
movement).</p>

<p>3. Terms indicating a slower tempo combined with an increase
in power.</p>

<p><i>Largando</i>, <i>allargando.</i> These words are both derived from
<i>largo</i>, meaning large, broad.</p></div>

<p>(For terms indicating both slower tempo and softer tone, see
<a href="#Page_59">page 59</a>,
<a href="#SEC_127">Sec. 127</a>.)</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The student should note the difference between groups 1 and 2
as given above: the terms in group 1 indicate that each
measure, and even each pulse in the measure, is a little
slower than the preceding one, while such terms as <i>pi&#249; lento</i>
and <i>meno mosso</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> indicate a rate of speed becoming instantly
slower and extending over an entire phrase or passage. Some
composers (<i>e.g.</i>, Beethoven and Couperin) have evidently had
this same distinction in mind between <i>rallentando</i> and
<i>ritardando</i> on the one hand, and <i>ritenuto</i> and <i>ritenente</i>
on the other, considering the former (<i>rall.</i> and <i>rit.</i>) to
indicate a gradually slackening speed, and the latter
(<i>ritenuto</i> and <i>ritenente</i>) to indicate a definitely slower
rate. The majority of composers do not however differentiate
between them in this way, and it will therefore hardly be
worth while for the student to try to remember the
distinction.</p></div>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Terms indicating a more rapid tempo.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Terms indicating a gradual acceleration.</p>

<p><i>Accelerando</i>, <span lang="el" title="Transcriber's Note: Corrected misspelling affretando"><i>affrettando</i></span>
(this term implies some degree of excitement also), <i>stringendo</i>,
<i>poco a poco animato</i>.</p>

<p>2. Terms indicating a tempo which is to become definitely
faster at once.</p>

<p><i>Pi&#249; allegro</i>, <i>pi&#249; tosto</i>, <i>pi&#249; mosso</i>, <i>stretto</i>, <i>un poco
animato</i>.</p></div>

<p>112. After any modification in tempo (either faster or slower) has been
suggested it is usual to indicate a return to the normal rate by some
such expression as <i>a tempo</i> (lit. in time), <i>a tempo primo</i> (lit. in
the first time), <i>tempo primo</i>, or <i>tempo</i>.</p>

<p>113. <i>Tempo rubato</i> (or <i>a tempo rubato</i>) means literally <i>in robbed
time</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, duration taken from one measure or beat and given to
another, but in modern practice the term is quite generally applied to
any irregularity of rhythm or tempo not definitely indicated in the
score.</p>

<p>The terms <i>ad libitum</i>, (<i>ad lib.</i>), <i>a piacere</i>, and <i>a capriccio</i>,
also indicate a modification of the tempo at the will of the performer.
<i>Ad libitum</i> means at liberty; <i>a piacere</i>, at pleasure; and <i>a
capriccio</i>, at the caprice (of the performer).</p>

<p>114. The term <i>tempo giusto</i> is the opposite of <i>tempo rubato</i> (and of
the other terms defined in paragraph 113). It means literally <i>in exact
time</i>. (<i>Tempo giusto</i> is sometimes translated <i>quite rapidly</i>,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> but
this is very unusual.)</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>115. <i>L'istesso tempo</i> means&#8212;at the same rate of speed. <i>E.g.</i>, when a
measure signature changes from 2/4 to 6/8 with a change in beat-note
from a quarter to a dotted-quarter, but with the same tempo carried
through the entire movement.</p>

<p>116. <i>Tenuto</i> (<i>ten.</i>) indicates that a tone or chord is to be held to
its full value. This word is sometimes used after a staccato passage to
show that the staccato effect is to be discontinued, but is often used
merely as a warning not to slight a melody-tone&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, to give it its
full value.</p>

<p>117. <i>Veloce</i> means&#8212;swiftly, and is applied to brilliant passages
(<i>e.g.</i>, cadenzas) which are to be played as rapidly as possible without
much regard for measure rhythm. The words <i>rapidamente</i>, <i>brillante</i> and
<i>volante</i> (flying) have the same meaning as <i>veloce</i>.</p>

<p>118. The following <i>expressions referring to tempo</i> are also in common
use but cannot easily be classified with any of the groups already
defined.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Con moto</i>&#8212;with motion; <i>i.e.</i>, not too slow.</p>

<p><i>Pesante</i>&#8212;slowly, heavily.</p>

<p><i>Doppio movimento</i>&#8212;twice as rapid as before.</p>

<p><i>Tempo ordinario</i>&#8212;in ordinary tempo.</p>

<p><i>Tempo commodo</i>&#8212;in convenient tempo.</p>

<p><i>Sempre lento malinconico assai</i>&#8212;always slowly and in a very
melancholy style.</p>

<p><i>Animando</i>, <i>animato</i>, <i>con anima</i>&#8212;with animation.</p>

<p><i>Agitato</i>&#8212;agitated.</p></div>

<p>119. <i>Tempo di marcia</i> is given by Riemann (Dictionary of Music, p. 783)
as equivalent to <i>andante</i>, M.M. 72-84. The same writer gives <i>tempo di
menuetto</i> as equivalent to <i>allegretto</i>, and <i>tempo di valso</i> as
equivalent to <i>allegro moderato</i> (which he regards as indicating a more
rapid tempo than <i>allegretto</i>).</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Dynamics</span></h2>


<p><a name="SEC_120">120.</a> The word <i>dynamics</i> (cf. dynamic&#8212;the opposite of static) as used
in the nomenclature of music has to do with the various degrees of power
(<i>i.e.</i>, the comparative loudness and softness) of tones.</p>

<p>As in the case of words referring to tempo, the expressions referring to
<i>dynamics</i> are always relative, never absolute; it is possible to
indicate that one measure is to be louder than another, but it is not
possible (nor desirable) to indicate exactly how loud either is to be.
Thus <i>dynamics</i>, perhaps even more than tempo, will be seen to depend on
the taste of the performer or conductor.</p>

<p>The following <i>words referring to dynamics</i> are in common use:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Pianisissimo</i> (<i>ppp</i>)&#8212;as softly as possible. (It will be
noted that this is a sort of hyper-superlative of <i>piano</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Pianissimo</i> (<i>pp</i>)&#8212;very softly. (The superlative of
<i>piano</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Piano</i> (<i>p</i>)&#8212;softly.</p>

<p><i>Mezzo piano</i> (<i>mp</i>)&#8212;medium softly.</p>

<p><i>Mezzo forte</i> (<i>mf</i>)&#8212;medium loudly.</p>

<p><i>Forte</i> (<i>f</i>)&#8212;loudly (lit. strong).</p>

<p><i>Fortissimo</i> (<i>ff</i>)&#8212;very loudly. (The superlative of
<i>forte</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Fortisissimo</i> (<i>fff</i>)&#8212;as loudly as possible.</p>

<p>The lack of a one-word comparative degree in the case of both
<i>piano</i> and <i>forte</i> seems to necessitate the hyper-superlative
degree as given above, but the practice of using four, or even
five <i>p</i>'s or <i>f</i>'s is not desirable.</p></div>

<p>121. The terms defined in <a href="#SEC_120">Sec. 120</a> are often combined with others, as
<i>e.g.</i>,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Pianissimo possibile</i>&#8212;as softly as possible.</p>

<p><i>Piano assai</i>&#8212;very softly.</p>

<p><i>Fortissimo possibile</i>&#8212;as loudly as possible.</p>

<p><i>Forte piano</i> (<i>fp</i>)&#8212;loud, followed at once by soft.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>As in the case of terms relating to tempo, the meaning of many other
expressions relating to <i>dynamics</i> may easily be arrived at by recalling
the list of auxiliary terms quoted under <a href="#SEC_96">Sec. 96</a>.</p>

<p>122. The terms <i>sforzando</i>, <i>forzando</i>, <i>sforzato</i> and <i>forzato</i> all
indicate a strong accent on a single tone or chord. These words are
abbreviated as follows:&#8212;<i>sf</i>,<i>fz</i>, and <i>sfz</i>, the abbreviation being
placed directly above (sometimes below) the note or chord affected. The
signs <img src="images/vaccent.jpg" width="12" height="12" alt="vertical accent" title="vertical accent" /> and
<img src="images/haccent.jpg" width="22" height="12" alt="horizontal accent" title="horizontal accent" /> are also
commonly used to indicate such an accent.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In interpreting these accent marks the student must bear in
mind again the fact that they have a relative rather than an
absolute meaning: the mark <i>sf</i> occurring in the midst of a
<i>piano</i> passage will indicate a much milder form of accent
than would the same mark occurring in the midst of a <i>forte</i>
passage.</p></div>

<p>123. The words <i>rinforzando</i> and <i>rinforzato</i> (abb.&#8212;<i>rinf.</i> and <i>rfz.</i>)
mean literally <i>reinforced</i>, and are used to indicate a sudden increase
in power usually extending over an entire phrase or passage instead of
applying only to a single tone or chord as in the case of <i>sforzando</i>,
etc.</p>

<p>124. <i>Crescendo</i> (abb.&#8212;<i>cresc.</i> or
<img src="images/crescendo.jpg" width="42" height="12" alt="crescendo" title="crescendo" />) means a gradual
increase in power. It will be noted that this word does not mean <i>loud</i>,
nor does it mean a sudden increase in power unless accompanied by some
auxiliary term such as <i>subito</i>, or <i>molto</i>.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking there are <i>two varieties of crescendo</i>: (1) that in
which the same tone increases in power while being prolonged; (2) that
in which succeeding tones are each sounded more strongly than the
preceding one. The first variety is possible only on instruments giving
forth a tone which can be varied <i>after it begins</i>. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, the
human voice, the violin, the organ enclosed in a swell box, and certain
wind instruments, are all capable of sounding a tone softly at first and
gradually increasing the volume until the maximal point of power has
been reached. But on the piano, organ not enclosed in a swell-box,
kettle drum, etc., the power of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> tone cannot be varied after the
tone has once been sounded, and a <i>crescendo</i> effect is therefore
possible only in a <i>passage</i>, in rendering which each succeeding tone is
struck more forcibly than its immediate predecessor. This second variety
of <i>crescendo</i> offers a means of dramatic effect which may be employed
most strikingly, as <i>e.g.</i>, when a long passage begins very softly and
increases in power little by little until the utmost resources of the
instrument or orchestra have been reached. A notable example of such an
effect is found in the transition from the third to the fourth movements
of the Beethoven Fifth Symphony.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The difference between <i>sforzando</i>, <i>rinforzando</i>, and
<i>crescendo</i> should now be noted: <i>sforzando</i> indicates that a
single tone or chord is to be louder; <i>rinforzando</i>, that an
entire passage is to be louder, beginning with its first tone;
but <i>crescendo</i> indicates that there is to be a gradual
increase in power, this increase sometimes occurring during
the sounding of a single tone, but more often in a passage.</p></div>

<p>125. Certain <i>combinations of the word crescendo</i> with other words are
so common that they should be especially noted. Among these are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Crescendo al fortissimo</i>&#8212;keep on gradually increasing in
power until the fortissimo (or very loud) point has been
reached.</p>

<p><i>Crescendo subito</i>&#8212;increase in power suddenly (or rapidly).</p>

<p><i>Crescendo poco a poco</i>&#8212;increase in power very, very
gradually.</p>

<p><i>Crescendo poi diminuendo</i>&#8212;first increase, then diminish the
tone.</p>

<p><i>Crescendo e diminuendo</i>&#8212;same as <i>cresc. poi dim.</i></p>

<p><i>Crescendo molto</i>&#8212;increase in power very greatly.</p>

<p><i>Crescendo ed animando poco a poco</i>&#8212;growing gradually louder
in tone and quicker in <i>tempo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Crescendo ed</i> <span lang="el" title="Transcriber's Note: Corrected misspelling affretando"><i>affrettando</i></span>&#8212;gradually louder and faster.
</p>

<p><i>Crescendo poco a poco sin al fine</i>&#8212;crescendo gradually even
up to the very end.</p></div>

<p>126. <i>Decrescendo</i> (<i>decresc.</i> or
<img src="images/decrescendo.jpg" width="40" height="12" alt="decrescendo" title="decrescendo" />) means a gradual
diminishing of the tone. It is the opposite of <i>crescendo</i>. The word
<i>diminuendo</i> is synonymous with <i>decrescendo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Decrescendo</i> (or <i>diminuendo</i>) <i>al pianissimo</i> means&#8212;decrease
gradually in power until the <i>pianissimo</i> (or very soft) point is
reached.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="SEC_127">127.</a> A number of <i>terms referring to both softer tone and slower tempo</i>
are in use. The most common of these are:&#8212;<i>mancando</i>, <i>moriente</i>,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
<i>morendo</i>, <i>perdendo</i> (from <i>perdere</i>&#8212;to lose), <i>perdendosi</i>,
<i>calando</i>, and <i>smorzando</i>.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Such expressions are usually
translated&#8212;&quot;gradually dying away.&quot;</p>

<p>128. In piano music the abbreviation <i>Ped.</i> indicates that the damper
pedal (the one at the right) is to be depressed, while the sign
<img src="images/damper1.jpg" width="12" height="12" alt="damper release" title="damper release" /> shows that it is to be released. In many modern editions
this depression and release of the damper pedal are more accurately
indicated by the sign
<img src="images/damper2.jpg" width="55" height="15" alt="damper" title="damper" />.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The term <i>senza sordini</i> is also occasionally found in old
editions, indicating that the damper pedal is to be depressed,
while <i>con sordini</i> shows that it is to be released. These
expressions are taken from a usage in music for stringed
instruments, in which the term <i>con sordini</i> means that the
mute (a small clamp of metal, ivory or hardwood) is to be
affixed to the bridge, this causing a modification in both
power and quality of the tone. The damper on the piano does
not in any way correspond to the mute thus used on stringed
instruments, and the terms above explained as sometimes
occurring in piano music are not to be recommended, even
though Beethoven used them in this sense in all his earlier
sonatas.</p></div>

<p>129. The words <i>una corda</i> (lit.&#8212;one string) indicate that the &quot;soft
pedal&quot; (the one at the left) is to be depressed, while the words <i>tre
corde</i> (lit. three strings) or <i>tutte le corde</i> (all the strings) show
that the same pedal is to be released. These expressions refer to the
fact that on grand pianos the &quot;soft pedal&quot; when depressed moves the
hammers to one side so that instead of striking three strings they
strike only two (in the older pianos only one, hence <i>una corda</i>), all
three strings (<i>tre corde</i>) being struck again after the release of the
pedal.</p>

<p>130. Other terms relating either directly or indirectly to the subject
of dynamics are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Con alcuna licenza</i>&#8212;with some degree of license.</p>

<p><i>Con amore</i>&#8212;with tenderness.</p>

<p><i>Con bravura</i>&#8212;with boldness.</p>

<p><i>Con celerita</i>&#8212;with rapidity.</p>

<p><i>Con delicato</i>&#8212;with delicacy.</p>

very little bit.&quot; A liberal application of common sense will aid greatly
in the interpretation of such expressions.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Terms Relating to Forms and Styles</span></h2>


<p>132. A <i>form</i> in music is a specific arrangement of the various parts of
a composition resulting in a structure so characteristic that it is
easily recognized by the ear. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, although every fugue is
different from all other fugues in actual material, yet the arrangement
of the various parts is so characteristic that no one who knows the
<i>fugue form</i> has any doubt as to what kind of a composition he is
hearing whenever a fugue is played. The word <i>form</i> is therefore seen to
be somewhat synonymous with the word <i>plan</i> as used in architecture; it
is the structure or design underlying music. Examples of form are the
canon, the fugue, the sonata, etc.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Speaking broadly we may say that <i>form</i> in any art consists in
the placing together of certain parts in such relations of
proportion and symmetry as to make a unified whole. In music
this implies unity of tonality and of general rhythmic effect,
as well as unity in the grouping of the various parts of the
work (phrases, periods, movements) so as to weld them into one
whole, giving the impression of completeness to the hearer.</p></div>

<p>133. The primal <i>basis of form</i> is the repetition of some characteristic
effect, and the problem of the composer is to bring about these
repetitions in such a way that the ear will recognize them as being the
same material and will nevertheless not grow weary of them. This is
accomplished by varying the material (cf. thematic development), by
introducing contrasting material, and by choice of key.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_134">134.</a> The student should note at the outset of this topic the <i>difference
in meaning between</i> the terms <i>form</i> and <i>style</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> A <i>form</i> is a plan
for building a certain definite kind of composition, but a <i>style</i> is
merely a manner of writing. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, the <i>fugue</i> is a
<i>form</i>&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, it is a plan, which although capable of variation in
details, is yet carried out fairly definitely in every case; but
<i>counterpoint</i> is merely a <i>style</i> or manner of writing (just as Gothic
architecture is a style of building), which may be cast into any one of
several <i>forms</i>.</p>

<p>135. The material found in the following sections is an attempt to
explain in simple language certain terms relating to <i>forms</i> and
<i>styles</i> which are in common use; in many cases the definition is too
meagre to give anything but a very general idea, but it is hoped that
the student will at least be set to thinking and that he will eventually
be led to a more detailed and scholarly study of the subject. (The
article &quot;Form&quot; and the separate articles under each term here defined,
as found in Grove's Dictionary, are especially recommended. For examples
of the various forms described, see also Mason and Surette&#8212;&quot;The
Appreciation of Music,&quot; Supplementary Volume.)</p>

<p>136. In a very general way there may be said to be <i>two styles of
musical composition</i>, the monophonic (or homophonic)&#8212;the
one-voiced&#8212;and the polyphonic&#8212;the many voiced. The polyphonic<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
style antedates the monophonic historically.</p>

<p>137. In <i>monophonic music</i> there is one voice which has a pronounced
melody, the other voices (if present) supporting this melody as a
harmonic (and often rhythmic) background. An example of this is the
ordinary hymn-tune with its melody in the highest part, and with three
other voices forming a &quot;four-part harmony.&quot; The sonata, symphony, opera,
modern piano piece, etc., are also largely <i>monophonic</i>, though
polyphonic passages by way of contrast are often to be found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>138. In <i>polyphonic music</i> each voice is to a certain extent melodically
interesting, and the &quot;harmony&quot; is the result of combining several
melodies in such a way as to give a pleasing effect, instead of treating
a melody by adding chords as an accompaniment or support. Counterpoint,
canon, round, fugue, etc., are all <i>polyphonic</i> in style. The word
<i>contrapuntal</i> is often used synonymously with <i>polyphonic</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(Sections <a href="#SEC_139">139</a> to
  <a href="#SEC_143">143</a> relate especially to terms describing
polyphonic music.)</p></div>

<p><a name="SEC_139">139.</a> <i>Counterpoint</i> is the art of adding one or more parts or melodies
to a given melody, the latter being known as the &quot;cantus firmus,&quot; or
subject. It may therefore be broadly defined as &quot;the art of combining
melodies.&quot;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The word <i>counterpoint</i> comes from the three words &quot;<i>punctus
contra punctum</i>,&quot; meaning &quot;point against point.&quot; The word
point as here used refers to the <i>punctus</i>&#8212;one of the neumae
of the mediaeval system, these neumae being the immediate
predecessors of modern notes.</p>

<p>Both vocal and instrumental music have been written in
contrapuntal style. The familiar two- and three-part
&quot;inventions&quot; by Bach are excellent examples of instrumental
counterpoint, while such choruses as those in &quot;The Messiah&quot; by
Handel illustrate the highest type of vocal counterpoint.</p></div>

<p>140. <i>Imitation</i> is the repetition by one part, of a subject or theme
previously introduced by another part. If the imitation is exact, the
term <i>strict imitation</i> is applied, but if only approximate, then the
term <i>free imitation</i> is used in referring to it. The repetition need
not have the exact pitches of the subject in order to be <i>strict</i>; on
the contrary the imitation is usually at the interval of an octave, or a
fifth, or a second, etc. Fig. 57 shows an example of strict imitation in
which the <i>third</i> part comes in an octave <i>lower</i> than the first part.</p>

<p>141. A <i>canon</i> is a contrapuntal composition in the style of strict
imitation, one part repeating exactly (but at any interval) what another
part has played or sung. The term &quot;canonic style&quot; is sometimes applied
to music in which the imitation is not exact. An example of three-part
canon is given in Fig. 57.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The word <i>canon</i> means <i>law</i>, and was applied to this
particular form of composition because the rules relating to
its composition were invariable. It is because of this
non-flexibility that the <i>canon</i> is so little used as a form
at the present time: the modern composer demands a plan of
writing that is capable of being varied to such an extent as
to give him room for the exercise of his own particular
individuality of conception, and this the <i>canon</i> does not do.
For this same reason too the fugue and the sonata have
successively gone out of fashion and from Schumann down to the
present time composers have as it were created their own
forms, the difficulty in listening arising from the fact that
no one but the composer himself could recognize the form <i>as</i>
a form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> because it had not been adopted to a great enough
extent by other composers to make it in any sense universal.
The result is that in much present-day music it is very
difficult for the hearer to discover any trace of familiar
design, and the impression made by such music is in
consequence much less definite than that made by music of the
classic school. It is probable that a reaction from this state
of affairs will come in the near future, for in any art it is
necessary that there should be at least enough semblance of
structure to make the art work capable of standing as a
universal thing rather than as the mere temporary expression
of some particular composer or of some period of composition.</p></div>

<p>142. The common <i>school round</i> is an example of canon, each voice
repeating exactly what the first voice has sung, while this first voice
is going on with its melody. The <i>round</i> is therefore defined as a
variety of canon in which the imitation is always in unison with the
subject.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_143">143.</a> The <i>fugue</i> (Latin, <i>fuga</i> = flight) is a form of contrapuntal
composition in which the imitation is always in the dominant key,
<i>i.e.</i>, a fifth above or a fourth below. The imitation (called &quot;the
answer&quot;) may be an exact repetition of the subject (sometimes called
&quot;the question&quot;), but is usually not so.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The <i>fugue</i> differs from the canon also in that the subject is
given in complete form before the answer begins, while in the
canon the imitation begins while the subject is still going
on. The <i>fugue</i> is not nearly so strict in form as the canon
and gives the composer much greater opportunity for expressing
musical ideas. A canon may be perfect in <i>form</i> and yet be
very poor music; this same statement might of course be made
about any form, but is especially true in the stricter ones.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(Sections <a href="#SEC_144">144</a> to
  <a href="#SEC_160">160</a> relate particularly to terms used in
descriptions of <i>monophonic</i> music<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.)</p></div>

<p><a name="SEC_144">144.</a> A <i>phrase</i> is a short musical thought (at least two measures in
length) closing with either a complete or an incomplete cadence. The
typical <i>phrase</i> is four measures long. The two-measure <i>phrase</i> is
often called <i>section</i>. The word <i>phrase</i> as used in music terminology
corresponds with the same word as used in language study.</p>

<p>145. A <i>period</i> is a little piece of music typically eight measures
long, either complete in itself or forming one of the clearly defined
divisions of a larger form. The <i>period</i> (when complete in itself) is
the smallest monophonic form.</p>

<p>The essential characteristic of the <i>regular period</i> is the fact that it
usually consists of two balanced phrases (often called <i>antecedent</i> and
<i>consequent</i> or <i>thesis</i> and <i>antithesis</i>), the first phrase giving rise
to the feeling of incompleteness (by means of a cadence in another key,
deceptive cadence, etc.,) the second phrase giving the effect of
completeness by means of a definite cadence at the close.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The second half of the period is sometimes a literal
repetition of the first half, in all respects except the
cadence, but in many cases too it is a repetition of only one
of the elements&#8212;rhythm, intervals, or general outline. Figs.
58 and 59 show examples of both types. The principle almost
invariably holds that the simpler the music (cf. folk-tunes)
the more obvious the form of the period, while the more
complex the music, the less regular the period.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>146. The <i>primary forms</i> are built up by combining two or more periods.</p>

<p>The <i>small two-part primary form</i> (often called <i>song-form</i> or
<i>Lied-form</i>) consists of two periods so placed that the second
constitutes a consequent or antithesis to the first. The second half of
this second period is often exactly the same as the second half of the
first period, thus binding the two periods together into absolute unity.
The theme of the choral movement of the Ninth Symphony (Beethoven)
quoted below is a perfect example of this form. Other examples are
&quot;Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes,&quot; and &quot;The Last Rose of Summer.&quot;</p>

<p>The <i>small three-part primary form</i> is like the two-part primary form
except that it has a section of contrasting material interpolated
between the two periods. This middle part is usually an eight-measure
phrase.</p>

<p>The <i>large two- and three-part primary forms</i> usually have
sixteen-measure periods instead of eight-measure ones, but are otherwise
similar in construction.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>These various <i>primary forms</i> are used in constructing many
varieties of compositions, among them the <i>theme and
variations</i>, the <i>polka</i>, the <i>waltz</i>, the <i>march</i>, etc., as
well as most of the shorter movements in sonatas, quartets,
etc. They are used in vocal music also, but are less apt to be
regular here because the form of vocal music is largely
dependent upon the structure of the text.</p></div>

<p>147. A <i>theme</i> is a fragment of melody used as the subject of a fugue,
as the basis of the development section in &quot;sonata form,&quot; etc. Sometimes
it is a complete tune (often in period form), on which variations are
made, as <i>e.g.</i>, in the familiar <i>theme and variations</i>.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_148">148.</a> <i>Thematic development</i> consists in taking a short theme (or several
short themes) and by means of transposition, interval expansion and
contraction, rhythmic augmentation and diminution, inversion, tonality
changes, etc., building out of it a lengthy composition or section of a
composition. Fig. 60 <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>f</i> show how the theme
given in Fig. 60 (<i>a</i>) may be varied in a few of these ways. There are
hundreds of other fashions in which this same theme might be varied
without destroying its identity. For other examples of thematic
development see the development section of Sonata Op. 31, <span lang="el" title="Transcriber's Note: Corrected error Sec. 3">No. 3</span>, as
analyzed in <a href="#APPENDIX_E">Appendix E</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For further illustrations of development in the case of this
same theme, see&#8212;Christiani&#8212;The Principles of Expression in
Pianoforte playing, p. 144, ff. from which the foregoing
themes have been adapted.</p></div>

<p>149. A <i>rondo</i> is an instrumental composition (in homophonic style) in
which a certain theme appears several times almost always in the same
form (<i>i.e.</i>, not thematically varied), the repetitions of this theme
being separated by contrasting material.</p>

<p>The <i>rondo</i> is the oldest of the larger monophonic forms and has been
used in many different ways, but perhaps its most characteristic
construction is as follows: (1) Principal subject; (2) second subject in
dominant key; (3) principal subject; (4) third subject; (5) first
subject again; (6) second subject, in <i>tonic key</i>; (7) coda (or ending).</p>

<p>The student should note particularly the problem of repetition and
contrast (mentioned in <a href="#SEC_134">Sec. 134</a>) as here worked out, as the rondo was
the first monophonic form in which this matter was at all satisfactorily
solved, and its construction is especially interesting because it is
readily seen to be one of the direct predecessors of the highest form of
all&#8212;the sonata. Examples of rondos may be found in any volume of
sonatas or sonatinas.</p>

<p>150. A <i>suite</i> is a set of instrumental dances all in the same or in
nearly related keys. The first dance is usually preceded by an
introduction or prelude, and the various dances are so grouped as to
secure contrast of movement&#8212;a quick dance being usually followed by a
slower one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The suite is interesting to students of the development of
music as being the first form <i>in several movements</i> to be
generally adopted by composers. It retained its popularity
from the beginning of the seventeenth to the end of the
eighteenth centuries, being finally displaced by the sonata,
whose immediate predecessor it is thus seen to be.</p></div>

<p>The <i>suite</i> was formerly written for solo instrument only (harpsichord,
clavichord, piano) but modern composers like Dvo&#345;&#225;k, Lachner,
Moszkowski, and others have written suites for full orchestra also.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_151">151.</a> Among the dances commonly found in suites are the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Allemande</i>&#8212;duple or quadruple measure.</p>

<p><i>Bolero</i>&#8212;triple measure.</p>

<p><i>Bour&#233;e</i>&#8212;duple or quadruple measure.</p>

<p><i>Chaconne</i>&#8212;triple measure.</p>

<p><i>Courante</i>&#8212;a very old dance in triple measure.</p>

<p><i>Csardas</i>&#8212;Hungarian dance in duple or quadruple measure.</p>

<p><i>Gavotte</i>&#8212;quadruple measure.</p>

<p><i>Gigue</i> (or <i>jig</i>)&#8212;duple measure.</p>

<p><i>Habanera</i>&#8212;Spanish dance in triple measure.</p>

<p><i>Minuet</i>&#8212;slow dance in triple measure.</p>

<p><i>Mazurka</i>&#8212;Polish dance in triple measure.</p>

<p><i>Polonaise</i>&#8212;Polish dance in triple measure.</p>

<p><i>Rigaudon</i>&#8212;lively dance in duple or triple measure.</p>

<p><i>Sarabande</i>&#8212;triple measure.</p>

<p><i>Tarantella</i>&#8212;swift Italian dance in sextuple measure.</p></div>

<p>The <i>allemande</i> is especially interesting to students of music form
because of its relation to the sonata, it being the prototype of the
sonata-allegro (<i>i.e.</i>, the first movement of the sonata). The
<i>sarabande</i> and <i>courante</i> are likewise interesting as the prototypes of
the second movement, and the <i>bour&#233;e</i>, <i>minuet</i>, etc., for their
connection with the third movement.</p>

<p>152. The <i>scherzo</i> (lit. musical joke) is a fanciful instrumental
composition. It was used by Beethoven as the third movement of the
sonata instead of the more limited minuet, but is also often found as an
independent piece.</p>

<p>153. A <i>sonata</i> is an instrumental composition of three or more
movements (usually four), the first and last of which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> almost always
in rapid tempo. Each of these movements is a piece of music with a unity
of its own, but they are all merged together in a larger whole with a
broad underlying unity of larger scope. The composition receives its
name from the fact that its first movement is cast in <i>sonata-form</i>.
(See <a href="#SEC_157">Sec. 157</a> for description of sonata-form.)</p>

<p>When the <i>sonata</i> has four movements, these are usually arranged as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. A quick movement (<i>allegro</i>, <i>presto</i>, etc.), often
preceded by a slower introduction.</p>

<p>2. A slow movement (<i>largo</i>, <i>andante</i>, <i>adagio</i>, etc.).</p>

<p>3. A minuet or scherzo, often with a trio added, in which case
the part preceding the trio is repeated after the trio is
played.</p>

<p>4. A quick movement&#8212;the finale, sometimes a rondo, sometimes
another sonata-form, sometimes a theme with variations.</p></div>

<p>These movements are all in closely related keys, but in a variety of
contrasting rhythms.</p>

<p>154. A <i>trio</i> is a sonata for three instruments (such as piano, violin,
and cello), while a <i>quartet</i> is a sonata for four instruments, the most
common quartet combination being as follows: First and second violins,
viola, and violoncello.</p>

<p>The term <i>chamber music</i> is often applied to instrumental music for
trio, quartet, quintet, and other similar combinations which are
suitable for a small room rather than for a large concert hall.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The words <i>trio</i> and <i>quartet</i> are also applied to vocal works
for three and four voices respectively, these having no
relation whatsoever to the sonata as described above. The word
<i>trio</i> is also applied to the middle section of minuets,
scherzas, marches, etc., the term originating in the old usage
of writing this part for three instruments only.</p></div>

<p>155. A <i>concerto</i> is a sonata for a solo instrument with orchestral
accompaniment, the form being usually somewhat modified so as to adapt
it to a composition in which there must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> necessarily be opportunity for
a good deal of technical display. There are usually but three movements
in the <i>concerto</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The great majority of <i>concertos</i> are for piano and orchestra,
but examples of concertos for violin, cello, flute, oboe, and
other solo instruments (all with orchestral accompaniment)
have also been written. A few modern composers have applied
the term <i>concerto</i> to certain large organ works (with no
orchestral accompaniment, the composition being written for
just the one instrument), but this use of the word is so
contrary to the accepted definition that it is hardly
justifiable.</p>

<p>When a concerto is played on two pianos (without orchestra),
this does not mean that there is no orchestral part, but that
there is no orchestra to play it, and so the parts that should
be played by the orchestral instruments have simply been
arranged for a second piano (sometimes organ).</p></div>

<p>156. A <i>symphony</i> is a sonata for full orchestra. In general its
construction is the same as that of the sonata, but it is usually of
much larger proportions and has in it much greater variety of both tonal
and rhythmic material. The symphony is generally conceded to be the
highest type of instrumental music ever evolved.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The <i>symphony</i> was accepted as a standard form in the time of
Haydn (1732-1809) and was developed enormously by Haydn
himself, Mozart (1756-1791), and Beethoven (1770-1827),
reaching perhaps its highest point in the famous &quot;Nine
Symphonies&quot; of the last-named composer. Later symphony writers
whose works are at present being performed include Schumann,
Tschaikowsky, and Dvo&#345;&#225;k.</p></div>

<p>The word <i>symphony</i> was formerly used synonymously with <i>ritornelle</i>,
both words being applied to instrumental interludes between parts of
vocal works, but this usage has now entirely disappeared.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_157">157.</a> <i>Sonata-form</i> (sometimes called <i>sonata-allegro</i>) is a plan for the
construction of instrumental music (sonatas, quartets, symphonies,
etc.), in which three rather definite divisions always occur, the third
division being a more or less literal repetition of the first.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>These <i>three parts of sonata-form</i> with their usual
subdivisions are:</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Exposition</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">(1) Principal theme (or first subject).</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">(2) Link-episode (or modulation group).</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">(3) Secondary theme (or song group), always in a nearly
related key.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">(4) Closing group.</span></p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">(5) Coda.</span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Development Section</span></p>

<p>Treating the themes introduced in the exposition in an almost
infinite variety of fashions, according to the principles of
thematic development. (See <a href="#SEC_148">Sec. 148</a>).</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Recapitulation (or Reprise)</span></p>

<p>Consisting essentially of the same subdivisions found in the
<i>exposition</i>, but differing from this first section in one
essential point, viz., that instead of stating the secondary
theme in a <i>related</i> key, the entire recapitulation is in the
<i>principal</i> key. This third section is always followed by a
coda (which may either be very short or quite extended),
bringing the whole movement to a more definite close.</p>

<p>The second part of <i>sonata-form</i> (the development section) is
sometimes the longest and most intricate of the three
divisions, and it is at this point that the composer has an
opportunity of displaying to the full his originality and
inventive skill. It is principally because of this development
section that the sonata is so far superior as a <i>form</i> to its
predecessors. For an analyzed example of <i>sonata-form</i>, see
<a href="#APPENDIX_E">Appendix E</a>. The student is advised to take other sonatas and
go through the first movements with a view to finding at least
the three main divisions mentioned above. In some cases the
form will of course be so irregular that all the parts
indicated cannot be discovered, but the general outlines of
the scheme will always be present.</p></div>

<p>158. A <i>sonatina</i>, as its name implies, is a little sonata. It differs
from the sonata proper principally in having little or no development,
the second section being of slight importance as compared with the
corresponding section of a sonata.</p>

<p>A <i>grand sonata</i> is like an ordinary sonata in form, but is of unusually
large dimensions.</p>

<p>159. <i>Program music</i> is instrumental music which is supposed to convey
to the listener an image or a succession of images that will arouse in
him certain emotions which have been previously aroused in the
composer's mind by some scene, event, or idea. The clue to the general
idea is usually given at the beginning of the music in the form of a
poem or a short description of the thing in the mind of the composer,
but there are many examples in which there is no clue whatsoever except
the title of the composition.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Program music</i> represents a mean between <i>pure music</i> (cf.
the piano sonata or the string quartet) on the one hand, and
<i>descriptive music</i> (in which actual imitations of bird-calls,
whistles, the blowing of the wind, the galloping of horses,
the rolling of thunder, etc., occur), on the other. Most
program music is written for the orchestra, examples being
Liszt's &quot;The Preludes,&quot; Strauss' &quot;Till Eulenspiegel,&quot; etc.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p><a name="SEC_160">160.</a> A <i>symphonic poem</i> (or <i>tone poem</i>) is an orchestral composition of
large dimensions (resembling the symphony in size), usually embodying
the program idea. It has no prescribed form and seems indeed to be often
characterized by an almost total lack of design, but there are also
examples of symphonic poems in which the same theme runs throughout the
entire composition, being adapted at the various points at which it
occurs to the particular moods expressed by the <i>program</i> at those
points.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The <i>symphonic poem</i> was invented by Liszt (1811-1886) and has
since been used extensively by Strauss, Saint-Sa&#235;ns and
others. It came into existence as a part of the general
movement which has caused the fugue and the sonata
successively to go out of fashion, viz., the tendency to
invent forms which would not hamper the composer in any way,
but would leave him absolutely free to express his ideas in
his own individual way.</p></div>

<h2><span class="smcap">Terms Relating to Vocal Music</span></h2>


<p>161. An <i>anthem</i> is a sacred choral composition, usually based on
Biblical or liturgical<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> words. It may or may not have an instrumental
accompaniment, and is usually written in four parts, but may have five,
six, eight, or more.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The word <i>anthem</i> is derived from <i>antifona</i> (or <i>antiphona</i>),
meaning a psalm or hymn sung responsively, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>antiphonally</i>, by two choirs, or by choir and congregation.</p></div>

<p>A <i>full anthem</i> is one containing no solo parts; a <i>solo anthem</i> is one
in which the solo part is predominant over the chorus, while a <i>verse
anthem</i> is one in which the chorus parts alternate with passages for
concerted solo voices (<i>i.e.</i>, trios, quartets, etc.).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_162">162.</a> <i>A capella</i> (sometimes spelled <i>cappella</i>) or <i>alla capella music</i>
is part-singing (either sacred or secular) without accompaniment.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This term means literally &quot;in chapel style,&quot; and refers to the
fact that in the early days of the church all singing was
unaccompanied.</p></div>

<p>163. <i>A motet</i> is a sacred choral composition in contrapuntal style. It
has no solo parts, thus corresponding to the madrigal (q.v.) in secular
music. The motet is intended for <i>a capella</i> performance, but is often
given with organ accompaniment.</p>

<p>164. A <i>choral</i> is a hymn-tune of the German Protestant Church. It is
usually harmonized in four voices. The <i>choral</i> (sometimes spelled
<i>chorale</i>) is described as having &quot;a plain melody, a strong harmony, and
a stately rhythm.&quot; It differs from the ordinary English and American
hymn-tune in being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> usually sung at a much slower tempo, and in having a
pause at the end of each line of text.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_165">165.</a> The <i>mass</i> is the liturgy for the celebration of the Lord's Supper
in the service of the Roman Catholic Church. As used in the terminology
of music the word refers to the six hymns which are always included when
a composer writes a musical <i>mass</i>, and which form the basis of the
celebration of the Communion.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> These six hymns are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Kyrie.</i></p>

<p><i>Gloria</i> (including the <i>Gratias agimus</i>, <i>Qui tollis</i>,
<i>Quoniam</i>, <i>Cum Sancto Spirito</i>).</p>

<p><i>Credo</i> (including the <i>Et Incarnatus</i>, <i>Crucifixus</i>, and <i>Et
Resurrexit</i>).</p>

<p><i>Sanctus</i> (including the <i>Hosanna</i>).</p>

<p><i>Benedictus.</i></p>

<p><i>Agnus Dei</i> (including the <i>Dona nobis</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>requiem mass</i> is the &quot;mass for the dead&quot; and differs
considerably from the ordinary mass. Both regular and requiem
<i>masses</i> have been written by many of the great composers
(Bach, Beethoven, Verdi, Gounod), and in many cases these
<i>masses</i> are so complex that they are not practicable for the
actual service of the Church, and are therefore performed only
by large choral societies, as concert works.</p></div>

<p>166. A <i>cantata</i> is a vocal composition for chorus and soloists, the
text being either sacred or secular. The accompaniment may be written
for piano, organ, or orchestra.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>When sacred in character the <i>cantata</i> differs from the
oratorio in being shorter and less dramatic, in not usually
having definite characters, and in being written for church
use, while the oratorio is intended for concert performance.</p>

<p>When secular in subject the <i>cantata</i> differs from the opera
in not usually having definite characters, and in being always
rendered without scenery or action.</p>

<p>Examples of the <i>sacred cantata</i> are: Stainer's &quot;The
Crucifixion,&quot; Clough-Leighter's &quot;The Righteous Branch,&quot; and
Gaul's &quot;The Holy City.&quot; Examples of the <i>secular cantata</i> are:
Bruch's &quot;Armenius,&quot; Coleridge-Taylor's &quot;Hiawatha.&quot;</p></div>

<p>167. An <i>oratorio</i> is a composition on a large scale for chorus,
soloists, and orchestra, the text usually dealing with some religious
subject. The <i>oratorio</i>, as noted above, is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> intended for the church
service, but is written for concert performance.</p>

<p>168. An <i>opera</i> is a composition for vocal soloists, chorus, and
orchestra, with characters, action, scenery, and dramatic movement. It
is a drama set to music.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Grand opera</i> is opera with a serious plot, in which
everything is sung, there being no spoken dialog at all.</p>

<p><i>Opera comique</i> is a species of opera in which part of the
dialog is spoken and part sung. <i>Opera comique</i> is not
synonymous with <i>comic opera</i>, for the plot of opera comique
is as often serious as not. In fact the entire distinction
between the terms <i>grand opera</i> and <i>opera comique</i> is being
broken down, the latter term referring merely to operas first
given at the Opera Comique in Paris, and the former term to
those given at the Grand Opera House in the same city.</p>

<p>A <i>comic opera</i> is a humorous opera, the plot providing many
amusing situations and the whole ending happily. It
corresponds with the <i>comedy</i> in literature.</p>

<p>A <i>light opera</i> is one with an exceedingly trivial plot, in
which songs, dances, and pretty scenery contribute to the
amusement of the audience. The music is lively, but usually as
trivial as the plot.</p>

<p>The term <i>music drama</i> was used by Wagner in referring to his
own <i>operas</i>, and is also sometimes applied to other modern
<i>operas</i> in which the dramatic element is supposed to
predominate over the musical.</p></div>

<p>169. A <i>libretto</i> (lit.&#8212;little book) is the word-text of an opera,
oratorio, cantata, or some other similar work.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_170">170.</a> <i>Recitative</i> is a style of vocal solo common to operas, oratorios,
and cantatas, especially those written some time ago. Its main
characteristic is that the word-text is of paramount importance, both
rhythm and tone-progression being governed by rhetorical rather than by
musical considerations.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Recitative</i> undoubtedly originated in the intoning of the
priest in the ritualistic service of the Church, but when
applied to the opera it became an important means of securing
dramatic effects, especially in situations in which the action
of the play moved along rapidly. <i>Recitative</i> is thus seen to
be a species of musical declamation.</p>

<p>In the early examples of <i>recitative</i> there was scarcely any
accompaniment, often only one instrument (like the cello)
being employed to play a sort of obbligato melody: when full
chords were played they were not written out in the score, but
were merely indicated in a more or less general way by certain
signs and figures. (See &quot;thorough-bass,&quot; <a href="#Page_85">p. 85</a>,
<a href="#SEC_200">Sec. 200</a>.)</p>

<p>But about the middle of the seventeenth century a slightly
different style of <i>recitative</i> was invented, and in this type
the orchestra was employed much more freely in the
accompaniment, especially in the parts between the phrases of
the text, but to some extent also to support the voice while
singing. This new style was called <i>recitativo stromento</i>
(<i>i.e.</i>, accompanied recitative), while the original type was
called <i>recitativo secco</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, dry recitative).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>During the last century the style of <i>recitative</i> has been
still further developed by Gluck and Wagner, both of whom used
the orchestra as an independent entity, with interesting
melodies, harmonies and rhythms all its own, while the vocal
part is a sort of obbligato to this accompaniment. But even in
this latest phase of <i>recitative</i>, it is the word-text that
decides the style of both melody and rhythm in the voice part.
Fig. 61 shows an example of <i>dry recitative</i>, taken from &quot;The
Messiah.&quot;</p></div>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p><a name="SEC_171">171.</a> <i>Aria</i> is likewise a style of vocal solo found in operas, etc., but
its predominating characteristic is diametrically opposed to that of the
recitative. In the <i>aria</i> the word-text is usually entirely subordinate
to the melody, and the latter is often very ornate, containing trills,
runs, etc.</p>

<p>The rendition of this ornate style of music is often referred to as
&quot;coloratura singing,&quot; but it should be noted that not all <i>arias</i> are
coloratura in style.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The familiar solos from The Messiah&#8212;&quot;Rejoice Greatly,&quot; and
&quot;The trumpet shall sound&quot; are good examples of the aria style.</p></div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>172. A <i>lied</i> (Ger. = song) is a vocal solo in which the text, the
melody, and the accompaniment contribute more or less equally to the
effect of the whole.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Strictly speaking the word <i>lied</i> means &quot;a poem to be sung,&quot;
and this meaning will explain at once the difference between
the <i>lied</i> on the one hand, and the Italian recitative and
aria on the other, for in the <i>lied</i> the text is of great
importance, but the music is also interesting, while in the
recitative the text was important but the music very slight,
and in the aria the text was usually inconsequential while the
music held the center of interest.</p></div>

<p>The most pronounced characteristic of the <i>lied</i> is the fact that it
usually portrays a single mood, sentiment, or picture, thus differing
from the ballad, which is narrative in style. It will be noted that this
&quot;single mood, or sentiment, or picture&quot; was originally conceived by the
poet who wrote the word-text, and that the composer in writing music to
this text has first tried to get at the thought of the poet, and has
then attempted to compose music which would intensify and make more
vivid that thought. This intensification of the poet's thought comes as
often through the rhythm, harmony, and dynamics of the accompaniment as
through the expressiveness of the voice part.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The style of song-writing in which each verse is sung to the
same tune is called the &quot;strophe form,&quot; while that in which
each verse has a different melody is often referred to as the
&quot;continuous&quot; or &quot;through-composed&quot; form (Ger.
durch-componiert).</p></div>

<p>173. A <i>ballad</i> was originally a short, simple song, the words being in
narrative style, <i>i.e.</i>, the word-text telling a story. In the earlier
<i>ballads</i> each verse of the poem was usually sung to the same tune
(strophe form), but in the <i>art-ballad</i> as developed by Loewe and others
the continuous style of composition is employed, this giving the
composer greater opportunities of making vivid through his music the
events described by the poem. These later <i>ballads</i> are in consequence
neither &quot;short&quot; nor &quot;simple&quot; but compare in structure with the lied
itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>174. A <i>folk-song</i> is a short song sung by and usually originating among
the common people. Its dominant characteristic is usually <i>simplicity</i>,
this applying to word-text, melody, and accompaniment (if there is one).
The text of the <i>folk-song</i> is usually based on some event connected
with ordinary life, but there are also many examples in which historical
and legendary happenings are dealt with. Auld Lang Syne, and Comin' thru
the Rye, are examples of <i>folk-songs</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There has been some difference of opinion as to whether a
song, the composer of which is known, can ever constitute a
real <i>folk-song</i>: recent writers seem to be taking the
sensible view of the matter, viz.: that if a song has the
characteristics of a folk- rather than an art-song, and if it
remains popular for some time among the common people, then it
is just as much a <i>folk-song</i> whether the composer happens to
be known or not.</p></div>

<p>175. A <i>madrigal</i> is a secular vocal composition having from three to
eight parts. It is in contrapuntal style, like the motet, and is usually
sung a capella.</p>

<p>176. A <i>glee</i> is a vocal composition in three or more parts, being
usually more simple in style than the madrigal, and sometimes having
more than one movement. The <i>glee</i> may be either gay or sad in mood, and
seems to be a composition peculiar to the English people.</p>

<p>177. A <i>part-song</i> is a composition for two or more voices, (usually
four) to be sung a capella. It is written in monophonic rather than in
polyphonic style, thus differing from the madrigal and glee. Morley's
&quot;Now is the Month of Maying&quot; is an example of the <i>part-song</i>, as is
also Sullivan's &quot;O Hush Thee, My Baby.&quot; The term <i>part-song</i> is often
loosely applied to glees, madrigals, etc.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Rhythm, Melody, Harmony and Intervals</span></h2>


<p>178. The <i>four elements</i> commonly attributed to music (in the order of
their development) are: Rhythm, Melody, Harmony, and Timbre (or
tone-color).</p>

<p>179. <i>Rhythm</i> is the regular recurrence of accent. In music it is more
specifically the regular recurrence of groups of accented and
non-accented beats (or pulses)&#8212;according to some specified
measure-system. Since rhythm implies continuity, there must usually be
at least two such measure groups in order to make musical rhythm
possible. (See <a href="#Page_44">p. 44</a>, <a href="#SEC_97">Sec. 97</a>.)</p>

<p>180. A <i>melody</i> is a succession of single tones of various pitches so
arranged that the effect of the whole will be unified, coherent, and
pleasing to the ear.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The soprano part of hymn-tunes and other simple harmonized
compositions is often referred to as &quot;the melody.&quot;</p></div>

<p>181. <i>Harmony</i> is the science of chord construction and combination.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The term <i>harmony</i> refers to tones sounding simultaneously,
<i>i.e.</i>, to <i>chords</i>, as differentiated from tones sounding
consecutively, as in melody. The word <i>harmony</i> may therefore
be applied to any group of tones of different pitches sounded
as a chord, although specifically we usually refer to a
<i>succession</i> of such chords when we speak of &quot;harmony.&quot; It is
possible to use the same combination of tones in either melody
or harmony; in fact these two elements as applied to modern
music have developed together and the style of present-day
melody is directly based upon the development that has
recently taken place in harmonic construction.</p>

<p><i>Harmony</i> (as contrasted with <i>counterpoint</i>) first began to
be an important factor in music about 1600 A.D., <i>i.e.</i>, at
the time when opera and oratorio came into existence, when
form was established, and when our modern major and minor
scales were adopted. Before this practically all music was
composed on a contrapuntal basis.</p></div>

<p>182. <i>Timbre</i> is that peculiar quality of sound which enables one to
distinguish a tone produced by one instrument (or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> voice) from a tone
produced by an equal number of vibrations on another instrument.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The word <i>timbre</i> is synonymous with the terms <i>quality of
tone</i>, and <i>tone quality</i> (Ger.&#8212;Klang-farbe), the excuse for
using it being that it expresses adequately in one word an
idea that in our language takes at least two: this excuse
would disappear (and incidentally a much-mispronounced word
would be eliminated) if the single word <i>quality</i> were to be
adopted as the equivalent of <i>timbre</i>. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, the
soprano voice singing c' has a <i>quality</i> different from the
contralto voice singing the same tone.</p>

<p>(The remainder of this chapter and all of <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">Chapter XVIII</a> deal
with terms commonly encountered in the study of <i>harmony</i>.
Courses in this subject usually begin with a study of scales,
but since this subject has already been somewhat extensively
treated, this chapter will omit it, and will begin with the
next topic in harmony study, viz.&#8212;the interval.)</p></div>

<p>183. An <i>interval</i> is the relation of two tones with regard to pitch. If
the two tones are sounded simultaneously the result is an <i>harmonic
interval</i>, but if sounded consecutively the result is a <i>melodic
interval</i>. Fig. 62 represents the pitches f' and a' as a harmonic
interval, while Fig. 63 represents the same pitches arranged as a
melodic interval.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/fig62-63.jpg" width="325" height="81" alt="Figs. 62-63" title="Figs. 62-63" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="music/fig62-63.mid">[Listen]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>184. In classifying intervals two facts should be constantly kept in
mind:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) The <i>number name</i> of the interval (third, fifth, sixth,
etc.), is derived from the order of letters as found in the
diatonic scale. Thus the interval C&#8212;E is a <i>third</i> because E
is the third tone from C (counting C as one) in the diatonic
scale. C&#8212;G is a <i>fifth</i> because G is the fifth tone above C
in the diatonic scale.</p>

<p>It should be noted however that the same <i>number-names</i> apply
even though one or both letters of the interval are qualified
by sharps, flats, etc. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, C&#8212;G<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> is still a
<i>fifth</i>, as are also C<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>&#8212;G<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> and C<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>&#8212;G<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>.</p>

<p>(2) In determining the <i>specific</i> name of any interval
(<i>perfect</i> fifth, <i>major</i> third, etc.), the half-step and
whole-step (often referred to respectively as <i>minor</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> <i>second</i>,
and <i>major second</i>) are used as units of measurement.</p>

<p>The <i>half-step</i> is usually defined as &quot;the smallest usable
interval between two tones.&quot; Thus, C&#8212;C<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> is a
<i>half-step</i>, as are also B&#8212;C, F&#8212;G<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, etc.</p>

<p>A <i>whole-step</i> consists of two half-steps. C&#8212;D is a
<i>whole-step</i>, as are also B<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>&#8212;C, E&#8212;F<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>,
F<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>&#8212;G<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>, G<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>&#8212;A<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>, etc.</p>

<p>The expressions <i>half-step</i> and <i>whole-step</i> are much to be
preferred to <i>half-tone</i> and <i>whole-tone</i>, as being more clear
and definite. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, the sentence &quot;The two tones are a
<i>half-step</i> apart&quot; is much better than &quot;The two tones are a
<i>half-tone</i> apart.&quot;</p></div>

<p>185. A <i>prime</i> is the relation between two tones whose pitches are
properly represented by the same degree of the staff.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A <i>perfect prime</i> is one whose tones have the same pitch.
Middle C sounded by piano and violin at the same time would

<p>193. A <i>ninth</i> is usually treated as a second, a <i>tenth</i> as a third,
etc. The interval of two octaves is often referred to as a <i>fifteenth</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>194. If the major diatonic scale be written and the interval between
each tone and the key-tone noted, it will be observed that the intervals
are all either major or perfect. See Fig. 64.</p>

<p>In this connection also it will be noted that the interval next smaller
than <i>major</i> is always <i>minor</i>, while that next smaller than <i>perfect</i>

than both <i>major</i> and <i>perfect</i> is <i>augmented</i>.</p>

<p>195. An interval is said to be <i>inverted</i> when the tone originally the
upper becomes the lower. Thus C&#8212;E, a major third, inverted becomes
E&#8212;C, a minor sixth.</p>

<p>196. A <i>chord</i> is a combination of several tones sounding together and
bearing an harmonic relation to each other. The simplest chord is the
<i>triad</i>, which consists of a fundamental tone called the <i>root</i>, with
the third and fifth above it. C&#8212;E&#8212;G is a triad, as are also D&#8212;F&#8212;A,
F&#8212;A&#8212;C, and G&#8212;B&#8212;D.</p>

<p>197. Triads are classified as <i>major</i>, <i>minor</i>, <i>diminished</i>, or
<i>augmented</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A <i>major triad</i> has a major third and a perfect fifth, <i>i.e.</i>,
it is a major third with a minor third on top of it. Ex.
C&#8212;E&#8212;G.</p>

<p>A <i>minor triad</i> has a minor third and a perfect fifth, <i>i.e.</i>,
it is a minor third with a major third on top of it. Ex.
C&#8212;E<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>&#8212;G.</p>

<p>A <i>diminished triad</i> has a minor third and a diminished fifth,
<i>i.e.</i>, it is a minor third with another minor third on top of
it. Ex. C&#8212;E<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>&#8212;G<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>.</p>

<p>An <i>augmented triad</i> has a major third and an augmented fifth,
<i>i.e.</i>, it is a major third with another major third on top of
it. Ex. C&#8212;E&#8212;G<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>.</p></div>

<p>198. A triad may be built on any scale-tone, but those on I, IV, and V,
are used so much oftener than the others that they are often called the
<i>common chords</i>. In referring to triads the Roman numerals are used to
show on what scale-tone the triad is based, the size of the numeral
(with other signs) indicating the kind of triad found on each tone of
the scale. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, the large I shows that the triad on the first
tone (in major) is a <i>major triad</i>, the small <span class="smcap">ii</span> shows that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> triad
on the second tone is minor, etc. The following figure will make this
clear.</p>

<p>199. A triad is said to be <i>in fundamental position</i> when its root is
the lowest tone. It is said to be in the <i>first inversion</i> when the
<i>third</i> is the lowest tone, and in the <i>second inversion</i> when the fifth
is the lowest tone. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, in Fig. 66 the same chord (C&#8212;E&#8212;G) is
arranged in three different positions, at (a) in fundamental position,
at (b) in the first inversion, and at (c) in the second inversion.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p><a name="SEC_200">200.</a> When the root is not the bass note, figures are sometimes used to
show what chord is to be played or written. Thus, <i>e.g.</i>, the figure 6
over a bass note means that the note given is the <i>third</i> of a chord,
the root being found by going up a sixth from the bass note: <i>i.e.</i>, the
chord is to be sounded in its first inversion. In the same way the
figures 6/4 indicate that the note given is the <i>fifth</i> of the chord,
the root and fifth being found by going up a sixth and a fourth from the
note given; <i>i.e.</i>, the chord is to be sounded in its second inversion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The use of these and other similar figures and signs is called <i>figured
bass</i> (or <i>thorough bass</i>) <i>notation</i>. An example of a <i>figured bass</i> is
given in Fig. 67.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Thorough bass notation</i> was formerly used extensively in
writing accompaniments to vocal works, the accompanist having
to interpret the notes and signs given, and then to make up an
interesting accompaniment as he went along. Much of Handel's
music was written in this way, but in modern editions of these
works the chords have been printed in full and the signs
omitted.</p></div>

<p><a name="SEC_201">201.</a> A <i>seventh chord</i> consists of a fundamental tone with its third,
fifth, and seventh. The fifth is sometimes omitted. A <i>ninth chord</i>
consists of a fundamental with its third, fifth, seventh, and ninth.</p>

<p>202. A <i>cadence</i> is the close of a musical phrase: in melody it refers
to the last two tones; in harmony to the last two chords.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The word <i>cadence</i> is derived from <i>cadere</i>, a Latin word
meaning to <i>fall</i>, the reference being to the falling of the
voice (<i>i.e.</i>, the dropping to the normal pitch) at the close
of a sentence.</p></div>

<p>203. The most frequent cadence in harmony is that involving the chord on
I preceded by the chord on V. Because of its directness the cadence V&#8212;I
is called the <i>authentic cadence</i>.</p>

<p>204. The most satisfactory form (to the ear) of the authentic cadence is
that in which the highest voice (the soprano) of the final chord is the
<i>root</i> of that chord. When the final chord appears in this position the
cadence is called <i>perfect</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> <i>authentic</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> and when the third or
fifth of the chord appear in the soprano, the cadence is called
<i>imperfect authentic</i>. Fig. 68 shows the chord G&#8212;B&#8212;D cadencing to
C&#8212;E&#8212;G in three different ways. The first one (a) is called a <i>perfect
authentic cadence</i>, but the last two (c) and (d) are <i>imperfect
authentic</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>205. A <i>plagal cadence</i> is one in which the tonic chord is preceded by
the sub-dominant chord (IV&#8212;I). The <i>plagal cadence</i> (sometimes called
the <i>church cadence</i>, or <i>amen cadence</i>), like the authentic, is
described as being <i>perfect</i> when the soprano of the tonic chord is the
root of that chord, and <i>imperfect</i> when the soprano of the final chord
is the third or fifth of that chord. Fig. 69 shows the chord F&#8212;A&#8212;C
cadencing to C&#8212;E&#8212;G in three ways. The first one (a) is called a
<i>perfect plagal cadence</i>, the last two are <i>imperfect plagal</i>.</p>

<p>206. A <i>half-cadence</i> occurs when the dominant chord is used as the
final chord of a phrase, and is immediately preceded by the tonic chord.
This form is used to give variety in the course of a composition, but is
not available at the end because it does not give a definite close in
the tonic key. Fig. 70 shows the use of the <i>half-cadence</i> at the close
of such a phrase.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>207. A <i>deceptive cadence</i> is the progression of the dominant chord to
some other chord than the tonic, the word <i>deceptive</i> implying that the
ear expects to hear V resolve to I and is deceived when it does not do
so. The most common form of <i>deceptive cadence</i> is that in which V (or
V<sup>7</sup>) resolves to VI. It is used to give variety, but as in the case of
the half-cadence, is not available at the end of a composition. Fig. 71

<p>209. <i>Modulation</i> is a change of key without any break in the continuity
of chords or melody tones. <i>Harmonic modulations</i> are usually effected
through the medium of a chord, some or all of whose tones are common to
both keys. Examples of both <i>harmonic</i> and <i>melodic modulations</i> are
shown in Figs. 74 and 75.</p>

<p>213. A <i>pedal point</i> (or <i>organ point</i>) is a tone sustained through a
succession of harmonic progressions, to the chords of some of which it
usually belongs. The term <i>pedal point</i> originated in organ playing,
(where the foot on a pedal can sustain a tone while the hands are
playing a succession of harmonies), but as now used it may be applied to
any kind of music. The dominant and tonic are the tones most often used
in this way. See Fig. 79.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

applied.</p>

<p>215. By <i>transposition</i> is meant playing, singing, or writing a piece of
music in some other key than the original. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, if a song
written in the key of G is too high in range for a soloist, the
accompanist sometimes <i>transposes</i> it to a lower key (as F or E), thus
causing all tones to sound a second or a third lower than they did when
the same song was played in the original key.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_A" id="APPENDIX_A"></a>APPENDIX A</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">The History of Music Notation</span></h2>


<p>Many conflicting statements have been made regarding the history and
development of music writing, and the student who is seeking light on
this subject is often at a loss to determine what actually did happen in
the rise of our modern system of writing music. We have one writer for
example asserting that staff notation was begun by drawing a single red
line across the page, this line representing the pitch <i>f</i> (fourth line,
bass staff), the <i>neumae</i> (the predecessors of our modern <i>notes</i>)
standing either for this pitch <i>f</i>, or for a higher or lower pitch,
according to their position <i>on</i> the line, or <i>above</i> or <i>below</i> it.
&quot;Another line,&quot; continues this writer, &quot;this time of yellow color, was
soon added above the red one, and this line was to represent c' (middle
C). Soon the colors of these lines were omitted and the <i>letters</i> F and
C were placed at the beginning of each of them. From this arose our F
and C clefs, which preceded the G clef by some centuries.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Another writer<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> gives a somewhat different explanation, stating that
the staff system with the use of clefs came about through writing a
letter (C or F) in the margin of the manuscript and drawing a line from
this letter to the neume which was to represent the tone for which this
particular letter stood.</p>

<p>A third writer<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> asserts that because the alphabetical notation was
not suitable for recording melodies because of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> inconvenience in
sight-singing &quot;points were placed at definite distances above the words
and above and below one another.&quot; &quot;In this system ... everything
depended on the accuracy with which the points were interspersed, and
the scribes, as a guide to the eye, began to scratch a straight line
across the page to indicate the position of one particular scale degree
from which all the others could be shown by the relative distances of
their points. But this was not found sufficiently definite and the
scratched line was therefore colored red and a second line was added,
colored yellow, indicating the interval of a fifth above the first.&quot;</p>

<p>It will be noted that all three writers agree that a certain thing
happened, but as in the case of the four Gospels in the New Testament,
not all the writers agree on details and it is difficult to determine
which account is most nearly accurate in detail as well as in general
statement. Communication was much slower a thousand years ago than now
and ideas about new methods of doing things did not spread rapidly,
consequently it is entirely possible that various men or groups of men
in various places worked out a system of notation differing somewhat in
details of origin and development but alike in final result. The point
is that the development of musical knowledge (rise of part-writing,
increased interest in instrumental music, etc.), demanded a more exact
system of notation than had previously existed, just as the development
of science in the nineteenth century necessitated a more accurate
scientific nomenclature, and in both cases the need gave rise to the
result as we have it to-day.</p>

<p>Out of the chaos of conflicting statements regarding the development of
music notation, the student may glean an outline-knowledge of three
fairly distinct periods or stages, each of these stages being intimately
bound up with the development of <i>music</i> itself in that period. These
three stages are:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(1) The Greek system, which used the letters of the alphabet
for representing fixed pitches.</p>

<p>(2) The period of the neumae.</p>

<p>(3) The period of staff notation.</p></div>

<p>Of the Greek system little is known beyond the fact that the letters of
the alphabet were used to represent pitches. This method was probably
accurate enough, but it was cumbersome, and did not afford any means of
writing &quot;measured music&quot; nor did it give the eye any opportunity of
grasping the general outline of the melody in its progression upward and
downward, as staff notation does. The Greek system seems to have been
abandoned at some time preceding the fifth century. At any rate it was
about this time that certain <i>accent marks</i> began to be written above
the text of the Latin hymns of the church, these marks serving to
indicate in a general way the progress of the melody. E.g., an upward
stroke of the pen indicated a rise of the melody, a downward stroke a
fall, etc. In the course of two or three centuries these marks were
added to and modified quite considerably, and the system of notation
which thus grew up was called &quot;neume notation,&quot; the word <i>neume</i>
(sometimes spelled <i>neuma</i>, or <i>pneuma</i>) being of Greek origin and
meaning a <i>nod</i> or <i>sign</i>.</p>

<p>This system of neumes was in some ways a retrogression from the Greek
letter system, for the neumes indicated neither definite pitches nor
definite tone-lengths. But it had this advantage over the Greek system,
that the position of the signs on the page indicated graphically to the
eye the general direction of the melody, as well as giving at least a
hint concerning the relative highness or lowness of each individual tone
(the so-called <i>diastematic system</i>), and this was a great aid to the
eye in singing, just as the relative highness and lowness of notes on
the modern staff is of great value in reading music at the present time.
Thus although the neumae did not enable one to sing a new melody at
sight as our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> modern staff notation does, yet they served very well to
recall to the eye the general outline of a melody previously learned by
ear and therefore enabled the singer (the system was used for vocal
music only) to differentiate between that particular melody and the
dozens of others which he probably knew. Neume notation was used mostly
in connection with the &quot;plain-song melodies&quot; of the Church, and since
the words of these chants were sung as they would be pronounced in
reading, the deficiency of the neume system in not expressing definite
duration values was not felt. But later on with the rise of so-called
&quot;measured music&quot; (cf. invention of opera, development of independent
instrumental music, etc.), this lack was seen to be one of the chief
disadvantages of the system.</p>

<p>The elements of neume-writing as given by Riemann in his Dictionary of
Music are:</p>

<p>&quot;(1) The signs for a single note: Virga (Virgula) and Punctus (Punctum).
(2) The sign for a rising interval: Pes (Podatus). (3) The sign for a
falling interval: Clinis (Flexa). (4) Some signs for special manners of
performance: Tremula (Bebung), Quilisma (shake), Plica (turn), etc. The
others were either synonyms of the above-named or combinations of
them....&quot;</p>

<p>Since music in the middle ages was always copied by hand, it will
readily be understood that these neumae were not uniform either in shape
or size, and that each writer made use of certain peculiarities of
writing, which, although perfectly intelligible to himself, could not
readily be interpreted by others (cf. writing shorthand). Here then we
observe the greatest weakness of the neume system&#8212;its lack of
uniformity and its consequent inability accurately to express musical
ideas for universal interpretation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Examples of several neumes are given merely in order to give
the beginner a general idea of their appearance.</p>

<p>Virga <img src="images/virga1.jpg" width="28" height="30" alt="virga" title="virga" /> or

<p>As music grew more and more complex, and especially as writing in
several parts came into use (cf. rise of organum, descant, and
counterpoint), it became increasingly difficult to express musical ideas
on the basis of the old notation, and numerous attempts were made to
invent a more accurate and usable system. Among these one of the most
interesting was that in which the words of the text were written in the
spaces between long, parallel lines, placing the initial letters of the
words <i>tone</i> and <i>semi-tone</i> at the beginning of the line to indicate
the scale interval. An example will make this clear.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/notation.jpg" width="325" height="97" alt="text notation" title="text notation" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>This indicated the precise melodic interval but did not give any idea of
the rhythm, and the natural accents of the text were the only guide the
singer had in this direction, as was the case in neume-notation and in
early staff-notation also. Various other attempts to invent a more
definite notation were made, but all were sporadic, and it was not until
the idea of using the lines (later lines and spaces) to represent
definite pitches, and writing notes of various shapes (derived from the
neumae) to indicate relative duration-values&#8212;it was only when this
combination of two elements was devised that any one system began to be
universally used.</p>

<p>Just how the transition from <i>neume</i> to <i>staff</i> notation was made no one
knows: it was not done in a day nor in a year but was the result of a
gradual process of evolution and improvement. Nor is it probable that
any one man deserves the entire credit for the invention of staff
notation, although this feat is commonly attributed to an Italian monk
named Guido d'Arezzo (approximate dates 995-1050). To this same monk we
are indebted, however, for the invention of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> syllables (UT, RE, MI,
etc.) which (in a somewhat modified form) are so widely used for
sight-singing purposes. (For a more detailed account of the transition
to staff notation, see Grove, op. cit. article <i>notation</i>.) It will now
be readily seen that our modern notation is the result of a combination
of two preceding methods (the Greek letters, and the neumes) together
with a new element&#8212;the staff, emphasizing the idea that <i>higher tones</i>
are written <i>higher</i> on the staff than lower ones. The development of
the neumes into notes of various shapes indicating relative time values
and the division of the staff into measures with a definite measure
signature at the beginning are natural developments of the earlier
primitive idea. In the system of &quot;musica mensurabilis&quot; or <i>measured
music</i> which was inaugurated a little later, the <i>virga</i> (which had
meanwhile developed into a square-headed neume) was adopted as the
<i>longa</i> or long note, and the punctus in two of its forms as <i>breve</i> and
<i>semi-breve</i> (short and half-short). The longa is now extinct, but the
modern form of the breve is still used as the double-whole-note, and the
semi-breve is our modern whole-note.</p>

<p>Red-colored notes were sometimes used to indicate changes in value and
before long outline notes (called <i>empty notes</i>) came into use, these
being easier to make than the solid ones. The transition from square-
and diamond-shaped notes to round and oval ones also came about because
of the greater facility with which the latter could be written, and for
the same reason notes of small denomination were later &quot;tied together&quot;
or <i>stroked</i>. This latter usage began about 1700 A.D.</p>

<p>It is interesting to find that when &quot;measured music&quot; was finally
inaugurated there were at first but two measure-signatures, viz.&#8212;the
circle, standing for three-beat measure (the so-called <i>perfect
measure</i>) and the semi-circle (or broken circle) which indicated
two-beat measure. Occasionally three-beat measure was indicated by three
vertical strokes at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> beginning of the melody, while two-beat measure
was shown by two such strokes. Upon the basis of these two varieties of
measure, primitive in conception though they may have been, has been
built nevertheless the whole system now employed, and in the last
analysis all forms of measure now in use will be found to be of either
the two-beat or the three-beat variety. The circle has disappeared
entirely as a measure-sign, but the broken circle still survives, and
from it are derived the familiar signs
<img src="images/common.jpg" width="22" height="24" alt="common time" title="common time" /> and
<img src="images/cuttime.jpg" width="20" height="29" alt="cut-time" title="cut-time" />, which are sometimes erroneously referred to as being
the initial letter of our word <i>common</i> (as used in the expression
&quot;common time&quot;). The transition from the older style of measure-signature
to the present one seems to have occurred during the century following
the invention of opera, <i>i.e.</i>, from about 1600 to about 1700 A.D.</p>

<p>The rest came into use very soon after &quot;measured music&quot; began to be
composed and we soon find rests corresponding with the various
denominations of notes in use, viz.:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/oldrests.jpg" width="515" height="96" alt="old rests" title="old rests" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>The terms applied to these rests vary in different authorities, but it
will be noted that the <i>pausa</i>, <i>semi-pausa</i>, and <i>suspirum</i> correspond
respectively to the double-whole-rest, whole-rest, and half-rest in use
at present.</p>

<p>The bar and double bar may be developments of the <i>maxima rest</i> (as some
writers suggest) but are probably also derived from the practice of
drawing a line vertically through the various parts of a score to show
which notes belonged together, thus facilitating score reading. The bar
may occasionally be found as early as 1500, but was not employed
universally until 1650 or later.</p>

<p>The number of lines used in the staff has varied greatly since the time
of Guido, there having been all the way from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> four to fifteen at various
times and in various places, (<i>four</i> being the standard number for a
long time). These lines (when there were quite a number in the staff)
were often divided into <i>groups of four</i> by <i>red</i> lines, which were not
themselves used for notes. These red lines were gradually omitted and
the staff divided into sections by a space, as in modern usage. The
number of lines in each section was changed to five (in some cases six)
for the sake of having a larger available range in each section.</p>

<p>The clefs at the beginning of the staffs are of course simply altered
forms of the letters F, C, and G, which were written at first by Guido
and others to make the old neume notation more definite.</p>

<p>The staccato sign seems not to have appeared until about the time of
Bach, the legato sign being also invented at about the same time. The
fermata was first used in imitative part-writing to show where each part
was to stop, but with the development of harmonic writing the present
practice was inaugurated. Leger lines came into use in the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>Sharps and flats were invented because composers found it necessary to
use other tones than those that could be represented by the staff
degrees in their natural condition. The history of their origin and
development is somewhat complicated and cannot be given here, but it
should be noted once more that it was the need of expressing more than
could be expressed by the older symbols that called forth the newer and
more comprehensive method. The use of sharps and flats in key signatures
grew up early in the seventeenth century. In the earlier signatures it
was customary to duplicate sharps or flats on staff degrees having the
same pitch-name, thus:
<img src="images/sharpsflats.jpg" width="174" height="66" alt="sharps and flats" title="sharps and flats" />. (The use of the G
clef as here shown did not of course exist at that time.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>The double-sharp and double-flat became necessary when &quot;equal
temperament&quot; (making possible the use of the complete cycle of keys) was
adopted. This was in the time of Bach (1685-1750).</p>

<p>Signs of expression (relating to tempo and dynamics) date back at least
as far as the year 1000 A.D., but the modern terms used for this purpose
did not appear until some years after the invention of opera, the date
given by C.F.A. Williams in Grove's Dictionary being 1638. These words
and signs of expression were at first used only in connection with
instrumental music, but were gradually applied to vocal music also.</p>

<p>Other systems of notation have been invented from time to time in the
course of the last two or three centuries, but in most cases they have
died with their inventors, and in no case has any such system been
accepted with anything even approaching unanimity. The tonic-sol-fa
system<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> is used quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> extensively in England for vocal music, but
has gained little ground anywhere else and the chances are that the
present system of notation, with possibly slight additions and
modifications, will remain the standard notation for some time to come
in spite of the attacks that are periodically made upon it on the ground
of cumbersomeness, difficulty in teaching children, etc. The main
characteristics of staff notation may be summed up as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Pitches represented by lines and spaces of a staff, the
higher the line, the higher the pitch represented, signs
called clefs at the beginning of each staff making clear the
pitch names of the lines and spaces.</p>

<p>2. Duration values shown by <i>shapes</i> of notes.</p>

<p>3. Accents shown by position of notes on the staff with regard
to bars, <i>i.e.</i>, the strongest accent always falls just after
the bar, and the beat relatively least accented is found just
before the bar.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Extent and description of beat-groups shown by
measure-signs.</p>

<p>5. Key shown by key signature placed at the beginning of each
staff.</p>

<p>6. Rate of speed, dynamic changes, etc., shown by certain
Italian words (<i>allegro</i>, <i>andante</i>, etc.), whose meaning is
as universally understood as staff notation itself.</p></div>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_B" id="APPENDIX_B"></a>APPENDIX B</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Musical Instruments</span></h2>


<p>1. Broadly speaking, musical instruments may be divided into two
classes, viz.: (1) those that have a keyboard and are therefore capable
of sounding several tones simultaneously; (2) those that (as a rule)
sound only one tone at a time, as the violin and trumpet. The piano is
of course the most familiar example of the first class, and a brief
description is therefore given.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The <i>piano</i> was invented about two hundred years ago by
Cristofori (1651-1731), an Italian. It was an enormous
improvement over the types of keyboard instrument that were in
use at that time (clavichord, harpsichord, spinet, virginal)
and has resulted in an entirely different style of
composition. See note on embellishments, <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>.</p></div>

<p>2. The most characteristic things about the <i>piano</i> as contrasted with
its immediate predecessors are: (1) that on it the loudness and softness
of the tone can be regulated by the force with which the keys are struck
(hence the name <i>pianoforte</i> meaning literally the <i>soft-loud</i>); (2) the
fact that the piano is capable of sustaining tone to a much greater
extent than its predecessors. In other words the tone continues sounding
for some little time after the key is struck, while on the earlier
instruments it stopped almost instantly after being sounded.</p>

<p>The essentials of the piano mechanism are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Felt hammers controlled by keys, each hammer striking two
or three strings (which are tuned in unison) and immediately
rebounding from these strings, allowing them to vibrate as
long as the key<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> is held down. The mechanism that allows the
hammers to rebound from the strings and fall into position for
another blow is called the <i>escapement</i>.</p>

<p>2. A damper (made of softer felt) pressing against each string
and preventing it from vibrating until it is wanted.</p>

<p>3. A keyboard action that controls both hammers and dampers,
causing the damper to leave the string at the same instant
that the hammer strikes it.</p>

<p>4. A pedal (damper pedal) controlling all of the dampers, so
that at any moment all the strings may be released so as to be
free to vibrate.</p></div>

<p>Other interesting details are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. The strings are stretched over a thin sheet of wood called
the sound-board. This aids greatly in intensifying the tone.</p>

<p>2. The soft pedal (the one at the left) in an <i>upright piano</i>
causes the hammers to move up nearer the strings, and the
shorter swing thus afforded causes a less violent blow and
consequently a softer tone. In the <i>grand piano</i> this same
pedal shifts the mechanism to one side so that the hammers
strike only one or two of the strings, this resulting in a
softer tone of somewhat modified quality.</p></div>

<p>These details regarding the mechanism of the piano can easily be
verified by removing the front of any ordinary upright piano and
observing what takes place when the keys are struck or the pedals
depressed.</p>

<p>3. There are two familiar types of <i>organ</i> in use at the present time,
(1) the reed organ, (2) the pipe-organ.</p>

<p>The <i>reed organ</i> is very simple in construction, the tone being produced
by the vibration of metal reeds (fixed in little cells), through which
air is forced (or sucked) from the bellows, the latter being usually
worked by the feet of the player.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> More power may be secured either by
drawing additional stops, thus throwing on more sets of reeds, or by
opening the knee swells which either throw on more reeds (sometimes
octave couplers) or else open a <i>swell box</i> in which some of the reeds
are enclosed, the tone being louder when the box is open than when
closed. More tone may also be secured by pumping harder.</p>

<p>4. The essential characteristic of the <i>pipe-organ</i> is a number of sets
or registers of pipes called <i>stops</i>, each set being capable (usually)
of sounding the entire chromatic scale through a range of five or six
octaves. Thus for example when the stop <i>melodia</i> is drawn (by pulling
out a stop-knob or tilting a tablet), one set of pipes only, sounds when
the keyboard is played on: but if the stop <i>flute</i> is drawn with
<i>melodia</i>, two pipes speak every time a key is depressed. Thus if an
organ has forty <i>speaking stops</i>, all running through the entire
keyboard, then each time one key is depressed forty pipes will speak,
and if a chord of five tones is played, two hundred pipes will speak.
The object of having so many pipes is not merely to make possible a very
powerful tone, but, rather, to give greater variety of tone-color.</p>

<p>The pipe-organ usually has a pedal keyboard on which the feet of the
performer play a bass part, this part often sounding an octave (or more)
lower than the notes indicate.</p>

<p>An <i>eight-foot stop</i> on the organ produces tones of the same pitches as
the piano when corresponding keys are struck: A <i>four-foot stop</i> sounds
tones an octave higher and a <i>two-foot stop</i> tones two octaves higher. A
<i>sixteen-foot stop</i> sounds tones an octave lower than the piano, and a
<i>thirty-two foot</i> stop, tones two octaves lower, while some organs have
also a <i>sixty-four foot</i> stop which sounds three octaves lower. This
gives the organ an exceedingly wide range, its compass being greater
than that of any other single instrument, and comparable in both range
of pitches and variety of color only with the modern orchestra.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Modern pipe-organs always have a number of <i>combination pedals</i> or
<i>pistons</i> (usually both), by means of which the organist is enabled to
throw on a number of stops with one movement. The selection and use of
suitable stops, couplers, combinations, etc., is called <i>registration</i>.</p>

<p>5. The instruments mentioned at the beginning of this appendix as
belonging to the second class are more familiar in connection with
ensemble playing, being commonly associated with either band or
orchestra.</p>

<p>6. A <i>band</i> is a company of musicians all of whom play upon either wind
or percussion instruments, the main body of tone being produced by the
brass and wood-wind divisions.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sousa's band is usually made up in somewhat the following
manner: 4 flutes and piccolos, 12 B<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> clarinets, 1 E<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>
clarinet, 1 alto clarinet, 1 bass clarinet, 2 oboes, 2
bassoons, 2 sarrusophones, 4 saxophones, 4 cornets, 2
trumpets, 1 soprano saxhorn (fluegelhorn), 4 French horns, 4
trombones, 2 contra-bass tubas, 4 tubas, 1 snare drum, 1 bass
drum, 2 kettle drums, cymbals, triangle, bells, castanets,
xylophone, etc.</p></div>

<p>7. An <i>orchestra</i> is a company of musicians performing upon stringed
instruments as well as upon wind and percussion. It is differentiated
from the band by the fact that the main body of tone is produced by the
strings.</p>

<p>There are <i>four classes of instruments</i> in the orchestra, viz.,
<i>strings</i>, <i>wood-wind</i>, <i>brass</i> (<i>wind</i>) and <i>percussion</i>. In addition
to these four classes, there is the <i>harp</i>, which although a stringed
instrument, does not belong in the same group as the other strings
because the manner of producing the tone is altogether different.</p>

<p>8. In the first group (the <i>strings</i>) are found the first and second
violins, viola, violoncello (usually spelled <i>cello</i>), and double-bass.
The first and second violins are identical in every way (but play
different parts), while the other members of the family merely represent
larger examples of the same type of instrument.</p>

<p>9. In the second group (the <i>wood-wind</i>) are found the flute, piccolo,
oboe, bassoon, English horn, double-bassoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> clarinet, and bass
clarinet. The English horn, double-bassoon, bass clarinet, and piccolo
are not called for in the older compositions, hence are not always
present in the orchestra.</p>

<p>10. In the third group (the <i>brass choir</i>) are found the French horn,
(usually referred to as <i>the horn</i>), trumpet (sometimes replaced by the
cornet) trombone, and tuba.</p>

<p>11. The fourth group (<i>percussion</i>) consists of kettle drums, bass drum,
cymbals, snare drum, triangle, bells, etc.</p>

<p>12. In an orchestra of about 100 players the proportion of instruments
is as about as follows, although it varies somewhat according to the
taste of the conductor, the style of composition to be performed, etc.:</p>

<p>18 first violins, 16 second violins, 14 violas, 12 cellos, 10 basses, 1
harp, 3 flutes, 1 piccolo, 3 oboes, 1 English horn, 3 clarinets, 1 bass
clarinet, 3 bassoons, 1 contra (or double) bassoon, 4 horns, 2 trumpets,
3 trombones, 1 tuba, 3 kettle drums, 1 bass drum, 1 snare drum, 1 each
of triangle, cymbals, bells, and other instruments of percussion,
several of which are often manipulated by one performer.</p>

<p><img src="images/violin.jpg" width="122" height="400" alt="violin" title="violin" class="floatr" />13. The cuts and brief descriptions here added will give at least a
rudimentary idea of the appearance and possibilities of the instruments
most commonly used in bands and orchestras. For fuller descriptions and
particulars regarding range, quality, etc., the student is referred to
Mason's &quot;The Orchestral Instruments and What They Do,&quot; Lavignac's &quot;Music
and Musicians,&quot; and to the various articles which describe each
instrument under its own name in Grove's Dictionary or in any good
encyclopaedia. For still fuller details some work on orchestration will
have to be consulted.</p>

<p>14. The <i>violin</i> has four strings, tuned thus
<img src="images/violintune.jpg" width="77" height="77" alt="violin strings g d' a' e''" title="violin strings g d' a' e''" />, these making available a range of about three and one-half octaves
(g&#8212;c''''). This range<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> may be extended upward somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> further by
means of <i>harmonics</i>, these being produced by lightly touching the
string at certain points (while the bow is moving across it) instead of
holding it down against the finger-board. The highest string of the
<i>violin</i> (viola and cello also) is often called the <i>chanterelle</i>
because it is most often used for playing the melody. The <i>violin</i>
ordinarily produces but one tone at a time, but by <i>stopping</i> two
strings simultaneously and so drawing the bow as to set both in
vibration, two tones may be produced at the same time, while three and
four tones can be sounded <i>almost</i> simultaneously.</p>

<p><img src="images/viola.jpg" width="171" height="400" alt="viola" title="viola" class="floatl" />The <i>mute</i> (or <i>sordino</i>) is a small clamp made of metal, wood, or
ivory, which when clipped to the top of the bridge causes the vibrations
to be transmitted less freely to the body of the violin, giving rise to
a tone modified in quality, and decreased in power.</p>

<p>For certain special effects the player is directed to pluck the string
(<i>pizzicato</i>), this method of playing giving rise to a dry, detached
tone instead of the smooth, flowing one that is so characteristic of the
<i>violin</i> as commonly played.</p>

<p><i>Violins</i> in the orchestra are divided into firsts and seconds, the
<i>first violins</i> being always seated at the left of the audience and the
<i>seconds</i> at the right.</p>

<p>15. The <i>viola</i> has four strings, also tuned in fifths, thus
<img src="images/violatune.jpg" width="75" height="122" alt="viola strings c g d' a'" title="viola strings c g d' a'" />. The <i>viola</i> looks exactly like the violin at
a little distance, and is really only a larger sized violin, having a
range a fifth lower. Its tone is not so incisive as that of the violin,
being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> rather heavier&#8212;&quot;more gloomy,&quot; as it is often described. The
<i>viola</i> is not so useful as the violin as a solo instrument because it
is not capable of producing so many varieties of color, nevertheless it
is invaluable for certain effects. In orchestral music it is of course
one of the most valuable instruments for filling in the harmony. The
<i>viola</i> players are usually seated behind the second violin players in
the orchestra.</p>

<p>
<img src="images/cello.jpg" width="173" height="500" alt="cello" title="cello" class="floatr" />16. The <i>violoncello</i> or <i>cello</i> (sometimes called <i>bass viol</i>) has four
strings, tuned thus:
<img src="images/cellotune.jpg" width="77" height="68" alt="cello strings C G d a" title="cello strings C G d a" />.
Its range is about three
and one-half octaves (from C to e'' or f''), but in solo work this range
is sometimes extended much higher. The <i>cello</i> is much more universally
used as a solo instrument than the viola and its tone is capable of a
much greater degree of variation. In the orchestra it plays the bass of
the string quartet (reinforced by the double-bass), but is also often
used for solo passages. <i>Con sordino</i> and <i>pizzicato</i> passages occur as
often for the <i>cello</i> as for the violin.</p>

<p><img src="images/doublebass.jpg" width="237" height="600" alt="double bass" title="double bass" class="floatl" />17. The <i>double bass</i> differs from the other members of the string
family in that it is tuned in <i>fourths</i> instead of in <i>fifths</i>. Its four
strings are tuned as follows
<img src="images/basstune.jpg" width="65" height="63" alt="bass strings EE AA D G" title="bass strings EE AA D G" /> the entire range
of the instrument being from EE to a. In music written for double-bass
the notes are always printed an octave higher than the tones are to
sound: that is, when the bass-player sees the note
<img src="images/bassc.jpg" width="63" height="32" alt="bass c" title="bass c" /> he
plays <img src="images/pedalc.jpg" width="63" height="46" alt="pedal C" title="pedal C" /> this being done to avoid leger lines. The tone
of the <i>bass</i> is much heavier and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> the instrument itself is much more
clumsy to handle than the other members of the group, hence it is almost
never used as a solo instrument but it is invaluable for reinforcing the
bass part in orchestral music. The mute is rarely used on the
<i>double-bass</i>, but the <i>pizzicato</i> effect is very common and the bass
pizzicato tone is much fuller and richer than that of any other stringed
instrument.</p>

<p>18. The <i>flute</i> has a range of three octaves.
<img src="images/fluterange.jpg" width="124" height="97" alt="flute range c' c''''" title="flute range c' c''''" />
It is used in both solo and orchestral playing as well as in bands. The
flute was formerly always made of wood, but is at present often made of
metal.</p>

<p>19. The <i>piccolo</i> is a flute playing an octave higher than the one
described above. The notes are printed as for the flute, but the player
understands that the tone is to sound an octave higher. The <i>piccolo</i> is
used widely in band music and quite often in orchestral music also, but
since the tone is so brilliant and penetrating and is incapable of any
great variation, it is not suitable for solo performance.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="images/oboe.jpg" width="113" height="400" alt="oboe" title="oboe" /><img src="images/contrabassoon.jpg" width="125" height="500" alt="contrabassoon" title="contrabassoon" /><img src="images/enghorn.jpg" width="79" height="900" alt="English horn" title="English horn" /><img src="images/piccolo.jpg" width="73" height="600" alt="piccolo" title="piccolo" /><img src="images/flute.jpg" width="57" height="600" alt="flute" title="flute" /><img src="images/bassoon.jpg" width="220" height="900" alt="bassoon" title="bassoon" /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>20. The next four instruments to be described (<i>oboe</i>, <i>bassoon</i>,
<i>English horn</i>, and <i>contra bassoon</i>) are often referred to as the <i>oboe
family</i> since the principle of tone production and general manipulation
is the same in all four. The tone in these instruments is produced by
the vibration of two very thin pieces of cane, which are called together
a <i>double-reed</i>.</p>

<p><img src="images/bassclarinet.jpg" width="171" height="500" alt="bass clarinet" title="bass clarinet" class="floatl" /><img src="images/clarinet.jpg" width="78" height="500" alt="clarinet" title="clarinet" class="floatr" />The <i>oboe</i> is especially valuable in the orchestra as a solo instrument,
and its thin, nasal tones are suggestive of rustic, pastoral simplicity,
both <i>oboe</i> and <i>English horn</i> being often used by orchestral composers
in passages intended to express the idea of rural out-of-door life. The
<i>English horn</i> is also often used in passages where the idea of
melancholy and suffering is to be conveyed to the audience. In a
military band the oboe corresponds to the first violin of the orchestra.</p>

<p>The <i>bassoon</i> and <i>contra-bassoon</i> are used mostly to provide a bass
part for the harmony of the wood-wind group, but they are also sometimes
employed (especially the <i>bassoon</i>) to depict comic or grotesque
effects.</p>

<p>21. The next two types of instruments to be described (<i>clarinet</i> and
<i>saxophone</i>) are alike in that the tone is produced by the vibration of
a <i>single</i> strip of cane (called <i>single reed</i>) which is held against
the lower lip of the player. The <i>clarinet</i> and <i>bass clarinet</i> are made
of wood and are used in both bands and orchestras, but the <i>saxophone</i>
is usually made of metal, and, the tone being more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> strident and
penetrating, the instrument is ordinarily used only in combination with
other wind instruments, <i>i.e.</i>, in bands.</p>

<p>Since the fingering of the <i>clarinet</i> is excessively difficult the
performer can play in only certain keys on the same instrument, hence to
play in different keys <i>clarinets</i> in several keys must be provided,
there being usually three in all. The music is written as though it were
to be played in the key of C, but the tones produced are actually in
other keys. For this reason the <i>clarinet</i> is called a <i>transposing
instrument</i>. The range of the <i>clarinet</i> is the greatest possessed by
any of the wind instruments, that of the clarinet in C being from
<img src="images/lowe.jpg" width="78" height="44" alt="e" title="e" /> to
<img src="images/g3.jpg" width="78" height="94" alt="g'''" title="g'''" />.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="images/saxes.jpg" width="522" height="650" alt="saxophones" title="saxophones" /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p><img src="images/sarrusophone.jpg" width="193" height="600" alt="sarrusophone" title="sarrusophone" class="floatr" />The <i>sarrusophone</i> is an instrument with a double-reed. It is made of
brass and exists in several sizes, the only one ever used in the
orchestra being the double-bass <i>sarrusophone</i>, which has approximately
the same range as the double-bassoon and is sometimes (but rarely) made
use of in the orchestra instead of the latter instrument. The tone of
the <i>sarrusophone</i> is something like that of the bassoon.</p>

<p><img src="images/frenchhorn.jpg" width="264" height="400" alt="French horn" title="French horn" class="floatl" />22. The <i>French horn</i> (often called <i>valve horn</i> or simply <i>horn</i>)
really consists of a long tube (about 16 feet) which is bent into
circular form for convenience in handling. Its range is from
<img src="images/doublepedalb.jpg" width="66" height="65" alt="BB" title="BB" /> to
<img src="images/highf.jpg" width="75" height="57" alt="f''" title="f''" />. In the orchestra <i>French
horns</i> are used in pairs, two of the players taking the higher tones,
and two the lower. The tone is intensely mellow but incapable of any
extensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> variation, but in spite of this lack of variety the tone
itself is so wonderfully beautiful that the instrument is one of the
most useful in the orchestra both in solo passages and to fill in the
harmony. The <i>horn</i> (as well as the trumpet and trombone) differs from
most of the wood-wind instruments in that its mouthpiece contains no
reed, the lips of the player constituting the vibrating body as they are
stretched across the mouthpiece and air is forced against them. The
<i>horn</i> is used in bands as well as in orchestras.</p>

<p>23. The range of the <i>trumpet</i> is
<img src="images/trumpetrange.jpg" width="77" height="83" alt="trumpet range g b''" title="trumpet range g b''" />, the typical
tone being brilliant and ringing. It is used in both band and orchestra,
playing the highest parts assigned to the brass choir. The <i>trumpet</i> is
often replaced in both band and orchestra by its less refined cousin the
<i>cornet</i> because of the ease with which the latter can be played as
compared with the trumpet, and the larger number of players that are
available in consequence of this ease of execution.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/trumpet.jpg" width="484" height="250" alt="trumpet" title="trumpet" /></p>

<p>
<img src="images/cornet.jpg" width="298" height="550" alt="cornet" title="cornet" class="floatr" />24. The <i>cornet</i> looks something like the trumpet, but is not so slim
and graceful in appearance. Its tube is only four and one-half feet
long, as compared with a length of about eight feet in the trumpet, and
sixteen feet in the French horn.</p>

<p>The range of the <i>cornet</i> in B<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> is from
<img src="images/lowe.jpg" width="78" height="44" alt="e" title="e" /> to
<img src="images/highbflat.jpg" width="84" height="73" alt="b-flat''" title="b-flat''" />. The tone is somewhat commonplace as compared
with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> trumpet, but because of its great agility in the rendition of
trills, repeated tones, etc., it is universally used in all sorts of
combinations, even (as noted above) taking the place of the trumpet in
many small orchestras.</p>

<p><img src="images/trombone.jpg" width="151" height="600" alt="trombone" title="trombone" class="floatl" />25. The pitch sounded by the <i>trombone</i> is altered by lengthening or
shortening the tube of which the instrument is constructed, this being
possible because the lower part slides into the upper and can be pulled
out to increase the total length of the tube through which the air
passes. There are usually three <i>trombones</i> in the orchestra, each
playing a separate part, and the combination of this trio (with the
<i>tuba</i> reinforcing the bass part) is majestic and thrilling, being
powerful enough to dominate the entire orchestra in <i>Fortissimo</i>
passages. But the <i>trombones</i> are useful in soft passages also, and
their tone when playing pianissimo is rich, serene, and sonorous.</p>

<p><img src="images/tuba.jpg" width="241" height="400" alt="tuba" title="tuba" class="floatr" />26. The <i>bass tuba</i> is a member of the saxhorn family<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> supplies
the lowest part of the brass choir, as the double-bass does in the
string choir. It is used in both orchestra and band, being often
supported in the larger bands by a still lower-toned member of the same
family&#8212;the <i>contra-bass tuba</i>. The range of the <i>tuba</i> is from
<img src="images/doublepedalg.jpg" width="67" height="74" alt="double pedal G" title="double pedal G" /> to
<img src="images/g1.jpg" width="73" height="57" alt="g'" title="g'" />.</p>

<p>27. The <i>kettle-drum</i> is the most important member of the percussion
family and is always used either in pairs or in threes. The size of
these instruments varies somewhat with the make, but when two drums are
used the diameter is approximately that given under the illustration.
The range of a pair of <i>drums</i> is <i>one octave</i>
<img src="images/drumrange.jpg" width="66" height="47" alt="F f" title="F f" /> and
when but two drums are used the larger one takes the tones from F to
about C of this range, and the smaller takes those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> from about B<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>
to F. The most common usage is to tune one drum to the <i>tonic</i>, and the
other to <i>the dominant</i> of the key in which the composition is written.
The pitch of the <i>kettle-drum</i> can be varied by increasing or lessening
the tension of the head by means of thumb-screws which act on a metal
ring.</p>

<p>The other important members of the percussion family are shown on this
and the following page, their use being so obvious as to require no
detailed explanation.</p>

<p><img src="images/harp.jpg" width="307" height="650" alt="harp" title="harp" class="floatr" />28. The <i>harp</i> is one of the oldest of instruments (dating back over
6000 years), but it is only in comparatively recent years that it has
been used in the symphony orchestra. Its range is from
<img src="images/doublepedalcflat.jpg" width="68" height="77" alt="double pedal C-flat" title="double pedal C-flat" /> to
<img src="images/fflat4.jpg" width="72" height="106" alt="f-flat''''" title="f-flat''''" />.</p>

<p>The modern <i>double-action harp</i> has forty-six strings, which are tuned
in half-steps and whole-steps so as to sound the scale of C<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> major.
It has a series of seven pedals around its base, each pedal having two
<i>notches</i> below it, into either of which the pedal may be lowered and
held fast. The first pedal shortens the F<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> string so that it now
sounds F, (giving the key of G<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>); the second one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> shortens the
C<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> string so that it sounds C (giving the key of D<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>); the
third pedal shortens the G<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> string so that it sounds G (giving the
key of A<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>); the fourth changes D<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> to D (giving the key of
E<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span>), and so on until, when all the pedals are fixed in their first
notches, the scale of C is sounded instead of C<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> as was the case
before any of the pedals were depressed. But if the first pedal is now
pushed down into the second notch the original F<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> string is still
further shortened and now sounds the pitch F<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> (giving us the key
of G), and if all the other pedals are likewise successively lowered to
the second notch we get in turn all the <i>sharp keys</i>&#8212;D, A, E, B,
F<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> and C<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span>, the last-named key being obtained as the result
of having all the pedals fixed in their second notches, thus making all
the tones of the original C<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> scale a whole-step higher so that they
now sound the C<span lang="el" title="sharp">&#9839;</span> scale.</p>

<p>Chords of not more than four tones for each hand may be played
simultaneously on the harp, but arpeggio and scale passages are the
rule, and are more successful than simultaneous chords. The notation of
harp music is essentially like that of piano music.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_C" id="APPENDIX_C"></a>APPENDIX C</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Acoustics</span></h2>


<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note</span>:&#8212;It is usually taken for granted that the student of
music is familiar with the significance of such terms as
<i>over-tone</i>, <i>equal temperament</i>, etc., and with principles
such as that relating to the relation between vibration rates
and pitches: the writer has in his own experience found,
however, that most students are not at all familiar with such
data, and this appendix is therefore added in the hope that a
few facts at least regarding the laws of sound may be brought
to the attention of some who would otherwise remain in entire
ignorance of the subject.</p></div>

<p>1. <i>Acoustics</i> is the science which deals with sound and the laws of its
production and transmission. Since all sound is caused by vibration,
<i>acoustics</i> may be defined as the science which treats of the phenomena
of sound-producing vibration.</p>

<p>2. All sound (as stated above) is produced by vibration of some sort:
strike a tuning-fork against the top of a table and <i>see</i> the vibrations
which cause the tone, or, if the fork is a small one and the vibrations
cannot be seen, hold it against the edge of a sheet of paper and hear
the blows it strikes; or, watch one of the lowest strings of the piano
after striking the key a sharp blow; or, look closely at the heavier
strings of the violin (or better still, the cello) and watch them
oscillate rapidly to and fro as the bow moves across them.</p>

<p>The vibrating body may be a string, a thin piece of wood, a piece of
metal, a membrane (cf. drum), the lips (cf. playing the cornet), the
vocal cords, etc. Often it is a column of air whose vibrations give rise
to the tone, the reed or other medium merely serving to set the air in
vibration.</p>

<p>3. Sound is <i>transmitted</i> through the air in somewhat this fashion: the
vibrating body (a string for example) strikes the air-particles in its
immediate vicinity, and they, being in con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>tact with other such
air-particles, strike these others, the latter in turn striking yet
others, and so on, both a forward and backward movement being set up
(oscillation). These particles lie so close together that no movement at
all can be detected, and it is only when the disturbance finally reaches
the air-particles that are in contact with the ear-drum that any effect
is evident.</p>

<p>This phenomenon of sound-transmission may perhaps be made more clear by
the old illustration of a series of eight billiard balls in a row on a
table: if the first ball is tapped lightly, striking gently against ball
number 2, the latter (as well as numbers 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) will not
apparently move at all, but ball number 8 at the other end will roll
away. The air-particles act upon each other in much this same fashion,
the difference being that when they are set in motion by a vibrating
body a complete vibration backward and forward causes a similar
<i>backward and forward</i> movement of the particles (oscillation) instead
of simply a <i>forward jerk</i> as in the case of the billiard balls.</p>

<p>Another way of describing the same process is this: the vibration of
some body produces waves in the air (cf. waves in the ocean, which carry
water forward but do not themselves move on continuously), these waves
spread out spherically (i.e. in all directions) and finally reach the
ear, where they set the ear-drum in vibration, thus sending certain
sound-stimuli to the nerves of hearing in the inner ear, and thus to the
brain.</p>

<p>An important thing to be noted in connection with sound-transmission is
that sound will not travel in a vacuum: some kind of a medium is
essential for its transmission. This medium may be air, water, a bar of
iron or steel, the earth, etc.</p>

<p>4. The <i>rate</i> at which sound travels through the air is about 1100 feet
per second, the rapidity varying somewhat with fluctuations in
temperature and humidity. In water the rate is much higher than in air
(about four times as great)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> while the velocity of sound through other
mediums (as <i>e.g.</i>, steel) is sometimes as much as sixteen times as
great as through air.</p>

<p>5. Sound, like light, may be <i>intensified</i> by a suitable reflecting
surface directly back of the vibrating body (cf. sounding board); it may
also be reflected by some surface at a distance from its source in such
a way that at a certain point (the focus) the sound may be very clearly
heard, but at other places, even those <i>nearer</i> the source of sound, it
can scarcely be heard at all. If there is such a surface in an
auditorium (as often occurs) there will be a certain point where
everything can be heard very easily, but in the rest of the room it may
be very difficult to understand what is being said or sung.</p>

<p><i>Echoes</i> are caused by sound-reflection, the distance of the reflecting
surface from the vibrating body determining the number of syllables that
will be echoed.</p>

<p>The <i>acoustics</i> of an auditorium (<i>i.e.</i>, its hearing properties) depend
upon the position and nature of the reflecting surfaces and also upon
the length of time a sound persists after the vibrating body has
stopped. If it persists longer than 2-1/4 or 2-1/3 seconds the room will
not be suitable for musical performances because of the mixture of
persisting tones with following ones, this causing a blurred effect
somewhat like that obtained by playing a series of unrelated chords on
the piano while the damper-pedal is held down. The duration of the
reverberation depends upon the size and height of the room, material of
floor and walls, furniture, size of audience, etc.</p>

<p>6. Sound may be classified roughly into <i>tones</i> and <i>noises</i> although
the line of cleavage is not always sharply drawn. If I throw stones at
the side of a barn, sounds are produced, but they are caused by
irregular vibrations of an irregularly constructed surface and are
referred to as <i>noise</i>. But if I tap the head of a kettle-drum, a
regular series of vibrations is set up and the resulting sound is
referred to as <i>tone</i>. In general the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> material of music consists of
tones, but for special effects certain noises are also utilized (cf.
castanets, etc.).</p>

<p>7. Musical tones have three properties, viz.:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>1. Pitch.</p>

<p>2. Intensity.</p>

<p>3. Quality (timbre).</p></div>

<p>By <i>pitch</i> is meant the highness or lowness of tone. It depends upon
rate of vibration. If a body vibrates only 8 or 10 times per second no
tone is heard at all: but if it vibrates regularly at the rate of 16 or
18 per second a tone of very low pitch is heard. If it vibrates at the
rate of 24 the pitch is higher, at 30 higher still, at 200 yet higher,
and when a rate of about 38,000 per second has been reached the pitch is
so high that most ears cannot perceive it at all. The highest tone that
can ordinarily be heard is the E<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> four octaves higher than the
highest E<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> of the piano. The entire range of sound humanly audible
is therefore about eleven octaves (rates 16-38,000), but only about
<i>eight</i> of these octaves are utilized for musical purposes. The tones of
the piano (with a range of 7-1/3 octaves) are produced by vibration
rates approximately between 27 and 4224. In the orchestra the range is
slightly more extended, the rates being from 33 to 4752.</p>

<p>Certain interesting facts regarding the relation between vibration-rates
and pitches have been worked out: it has been discovered for instance
that if the number of vibrations is doubled, the pitch of the resulting
tone is an octave higher; <i>i.e.</i>, if a string vibrating at the rate of
261 per second gives rise to the pitch c', then a string one-half as
long and vibrating twice as rapidly (522) will give rise to the pitch
c'', <i>i.e.</i>, an octave higher than c'. In the same way it has been found
that if the rate is multiplied by 5/4 the pitch of the tone will be a
<i>major third</i> higher; if multiplied by 3/2, a <i>perfect fifth</i> higher,
etc. These laws are often stated thus: the ratio of the octave to the
fundamental is as two is to one; that of the major third as five is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
four; that of the perfect fifth as three is to two, and so on through
the entire series of pitches embraced within the octave, the <i>ratio</i>
being of course the same for all octaves.</p>

<p><a name="SEC_9A">9.</a> The <i>intensity</i> (loudness or softness) of tones depends upon the
amplitude (width) of the vibrations, a louder tone being the result of
vibrations of greater amplitude, and vice versa. This may be verified by
plucking a long string (on cello or double-bass) and noting that when
plucked gently vibrations of small amplitude are set up, while a
vigorous pluck results in much wider vibrations, and, consequently, in a
louder tone. It should be noted that the <i>pitch</i> of the tone is not
affected by the change in amplitude of vibration.</p>

<p>The intensity of tones varies with the medium conveying them, being
usually louder at night because the air is then more elastic. Tone
intensity is also affected by <i>sympathetic vibrations</i> set up in other
bodies. If two strings of the same length are stretched side by side and
one set in vibration so as to produce tone the other will soon begin to
vibrate also and the combined tone will be louder than if only one
string produced it. This phenomenon is the basis of what is known as
resonance (cf. body of violin, resonance cavities of nose and mouth,
sounding board of piano, etc.).</p>

<p><a name="SEC_10A">10.</a> <i>Quality</i> depends upon the shape (or form) of the vibrations which
give rise to the tone. A series of simple vibrations will cause a simple
(or colorless) tone, while complex vibrations (giving rise to overtones
of various kinds and in a variety of proportions) cause more
individualistic peculiarities of quality. Quality is affected also by
the shape and size of the resonance body. (Cf. last part of <a href="#SEC_9A">sec. 9</a>
above.)</p>

<p>11. Practically every musical tone really consists of a combination of
several tones sounding simultaneously, the combined effect upon the ear
giving the impression of a single tone. The most important tone of the
series is the <i>fundamental</i>, which dominates the combination and gives
the pitch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> but this fundamental is practically always combined with a
greater or less number of faint and elusive attending tones called
<i>overtones</i> or <i>harmonics</i>. The first of these overtones is the octave
above the fundamental; the second is the fifth above this octave; the
third, two octaves above the fundamental, and so on through the series
as shown in the figure below. The presence of these <i>overtones</i> is
accounted for by the fact that the string (or other vibrating body) does
not merely vibrate in its entirety but has in addition to the principal
oscillation a number of sectional movements also. Thus it is easily
proved that a string vibrates in halves, thirds, etc., in addition to
the principal vibration of the entire string, and it is the vibration of
these halves, thirds, etc., which gives rise to the <i>harmonics</i>, or
<i>upper partials</i> as they are often called. The figure shows <i>Great C</i>
and its first eight overtones. A similar series might be worked out from
any other fundamental.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="music/greatc.mid">[Listen]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center">&#160;</p>

<p>It will be recalled that in the section (<a href="#SEC_10A">10</a>) dealing with <i>quality</i> the
statement was made that <i>quality</i> depends upon the shape of the
vibrations; it should now be noted that it is the form of these
vibrations that determines the nature and proportion of the overtones
and hence the quality. Thus <i>e.g.</i>, a tone that has too large a
proportion of the fourth upper partial (<i>i.e.</i>, the <i>third</i> of the
chord) will be <i>reedy</i> and somewhat unpleasant. This is the case with
many voices that are referred to as <i>nasal</i>. Too great a proportion of
overtones is what causes certain pianos to sound &quot;tin-panny.&quot; The tone
pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>duced by a good tuning-fork is almost entirely free from overtones:
it has therefore no distinctive quality and is said to be a <i>simple</i>
tone. The characteristic tone of the oboe on the other hand has many
overtones and is therefore highly individualistic: this enables us to
recognize the tone of the instrument even though we cannot see the
player. Such a tone is said to be <i>complex</i>.</p>

<p>12. The mathematical ratio referred to on <a href="#Page_134">page 134</a>, if strictly carried
out in tuning a keyboard instrument would cause the half-steps to vary
slightly in size, and playing in certain keys (especially those having a
number of sharps or flats in the signature) would therefore sound out of
tune. There would be many other disadvantages in such a system, notably
the inability to modulate freely to other keys, and since modulation is
one of the predominant and most striking characteristics of modern
music, this would constitute a serious barrier to advances in
composition. To obviate these disadvantages a system of <i>equal
temperament</i> was invented and has been in universal use since the time
of Bach (1685-1750) who was the first prominent composer to use it
extensively. <i>Equal temperament</i> means simply dividing the octave into
twelve equal parts, thus causing all scales (as played on keyboard
instruments at least) to sound exactly alike.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To show the practicability of equal temperament Bach wrote a
series of 48 <i>preludes and fugues</i>, two in each major and two
in each minor key. He called the collection &quot;The Well-tempered
Clavichord.&quot;</p></div>

<p>13. Various <i>standards of pitch</i> have existed at different times in the
last two centuries, and even now there is no absolute uniformity
although conditions are much better than they were even twenty-five
years ago. Scientists use what is known as the &quot;scientific standard&quot;
(sometimes called the &quot;philosophic standard&quot;), viz., 256 double
vibrations for &quot;middle C.&quot; This pitch is not in actual use for musical
purposes, but is retained for theoretical purposes because of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
convenience of computation (being a power of 2). In 1885 a conference of
musicians at Vienna ratified the pitch giving Middle C 261 vibrations,
this having been adopted by the French as their official pitch some 26
years before. In 1891 a convention of piano manufacturers at
Philadelphia adopted this same pitch for the United States, and it has
been in practically universal use ever since. This pitch (giving Middle
C 261 vibrations) is known as &quot;International Pitch.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Concert pitch</i> is slightly higher than <i>International</i>, the difference
between the two varying somewhat, but being almost always less than
one-half step. This higher pitch is still often used by bands and
sometimes by orchestras to give greater brilliancy to the wind
instruments.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX_D" id="APPENDIX_D"></a>APPENDIX D</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Terminology Reform</span></h2>


<p>A recent writer<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> on <i>vocal terminology</i> makes the following statement
as an introduction to certain remarks advocating a more definite use of
terms relating to tone production by the human voice:&#8212;&quot;The correct use
of words is the most potent factor in the development of the thinker.&quot;
If this statement has any basis of fact whatsoever to support it then it
must be evident to the merest novice in musical work that the popular
use of many common terms by musicians is keeping a good many people from
clear and logical thought in a field that needs accurate thinkers very
badly! However this may be, it must be patent to all that our present
terminology is in many respects neither correct nor logical, and the
movement inaugurated by the Music Section of the National Education
Association some years ago to secure greater uniformity in the use and
definition of certain expressions should therefore not only command the
respect and commendation, but the active support of all progressive
teachers of music.</p>

<p>Let it be noted at the outset that such reforms as are advocated by the
committee will never come into general use while the rank and file of
teachers throughout the country merely <i>approve</i> the reports so
carefully compiled and submitted each year: these reforms will become
effective only as individual teachers make up their minds that the end
to be attained is worth the trouble of being careful to use only
correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> terminology every day for a month, or three months, or a
year&#8212;whatever length of time may be necessary in order to get the new
habits fixed in mind and muscle.</p>

<p>The Terminology Committee was appointed by the Department of Music of
the N.E.A. in 1906 and made its first report at Los Angeles in 1907.
Since then the indefatigable chairman of the committee (Mr. Chas. I.
Rice, of Worcester, Mass.) has contributed generously of both time and
strength, and has by his annual reports to the Department set many of us
to thinking along certain new lines, and has caused some of us at any
rate to adopt in our own teaching certain changes of terminology which
have enabled us to make our work more effective.</p>

<p>In his first report Mr. Rice says:</p>

<p>&quot;Any one who has observed the teaching of school music in any
considerable number of places in this country cannot fail to have
remarked the great diversity of statement employed by different teachers
regarding the facts which we are engaged in teaching, and the equal
diversity of terminology used in teaching the symbols by which musicians
seek to record these facts. To the teacher of exact sciences our
picturesque use of the same term to describe two or more entirely
different things never ceases to be a marvel.... Thoughtful men and
women will become impressed with the untruthfulness of certain
statements and little by little change their practice. Others will
follow, influenced by example. The revolutionists will deride us for not
moving faster while the conservatives will be suspicious of any change.&quot;</p>

<p>At this meeting in Los Angeles a list of thirteen points was recommended
by the committee and adopted by the Music Department. These points are
given in the N.E.A. Volume of Proceedings for 1907, p. 875.</p>

<p>Since 1907 the committee (consisting of Chas. I. Rice, P.C. Hayden, W.B.
Kinnear, Leo R. Lewis, and Constance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> Barlow-Smith) have each year
selected a number of topics for discussion, and have submitted valuable
reports recommending the adoption of certain reforms. Some of the points
recommended have usually been rejected by the Department, but many of
them have been adopted and the reports of the committee have set many
teachers thinking and have made us all more careful in the use and
definition of common terms. A complete list of all points adopted by the
Department since 1907 has been made by Mr. Rice for <i>School Music</i>, and
this list is here reprinted from the January, 1913, number of that
magazine.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Terminology Adoptions</span>, 1907-1910</p>

<p>1. <i>Tone:</i> Specific name for a musical sound of definite
pitch. Use neither <i>sound</i>, a general term, nor <i>note</i>, a term
of notation.</p>

<p>2. <i>Interval:</i> The pitch relation between <i>two</i> tones. Not
properly applicable to a single tone or scale degree. Example:
&quot;Sing the fifth tone of the scale.&quot; Not &quot;sing the fifth
interval of the scale.&quot;</p>

<p>3. <i>Key:</i> Tones in relation to a tonic. Example: In the key of
G. <i>Not</i> in the scale of G. Scales, major and minor are
composed of a definite selection from the many tones of the
key, and all scales extend through at least one octave of
pitch. The chromatic scale utilizes all the tones of a key
within the octave.</p>

<p>4. <i>Natural:</i> Not a suitable compound to use in naming
pitches. Pitch names are either <i>simple</i>: B, or <i>compound</i>: B
sharp, B double-sharp, B flat or B double-flat, and there is
no pitch named &quot;B natural.&quot; Example: Pitch B, <i>not</i> &quot;B
natural.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span>:&#8212;L.R.L. thinks that B natural should be the name when
the notation suggests it.</p>

<p>5. <i>Step, Half-step:</i> Terms of interval <i>measurement</i>. Avoid
<i>tone</i>, <i>semi-tone</i> or <i>half-tone</i>. Major second and minor
second are interval <i>names</i>. Example: How large are the
following intervals? (1) Major second, (2) minor second, (3)
augmented prime. Answer: (1) a step, (2) a half-step, (3) a
half-step.</p>

<p>6. <i>Chromatic:</i> A tone of the key which is not a member of its
diatonic scale. (N.B.) An accidental (a notation sign) is not
a chromatic sign <i>unless</i> it makes a staff-degree represent a
chromatic tone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>7. <i>Major; Minor:</i> Major and Minor keys having the same
signature should be called relative major and minor. Major and
minor keys having the same tonic, but different signatures,
should be called tonic major and minor. Not &quot;parallel&quot; major
or minor in either case.</p>

<p>8. <i>Staff:</i> Five horizontal lines and their spaces. Staff
<i>lines</i> are named (numbered) upward in order, first to fifth.
<i>Spaces:</i> Space below, first-second-third-fourth-space, and
space above<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>. (Six in all.) Additional short lines and
their short spaces numbered outward both ways from the main
staff, viz: line below, second space below. The boundary of
the staff is always a space.</p>


<p>9. <i>G Clef, F Clef, C Clef:</i> These clefs when placed upon the
staff, give its degrees their first, or primary pitch meaning.
Each makes the degree it occupies represent a pitch of its
respective name. Example: The G clef makes the second line
represent the pitch G. Avoid &quot;<i>fixes G on</i>.&quot; The staff with
clef in position represents only pitches having <i>simple</i> or
<i>one-word</i> names, A, B, C, etc.</p>

<p>10. <i>Sharps, Flats:</i> Given a staff with clef in position as in
example above, sharps and flats make staff degrees upon which
they are placed represent pitches a half-step higher or lower.
These pitches have compound or two-word names. Example: The
second line stands for the pitch G (simple name). Sharp the
second line and it will stand for the pitch G sharp. (Compound
name.) The third line stands for the pitch B. (Simple name.)
Flat it, and the line will stand for the pitch B flat.
(Compound name.) N.B. These signs do not &quot;<i>raise</i>&quot; or
&quot;<i>lower</i>&quot; notes, tones, pitches, letters or staff degrees.</p>

<p>11. <i>Double-sharp, Double-flat:</i> Given a staff with three or
more degrees sharped in the signature, double-sharps are used
(subject to the rules governing composition) to make certain
of these degrees, already sharped, represent pitches one
half-step higher yet. Similarly, when three or more degrees
are flatted in the signature, double-flats are used to make
certain degrees already flatted, represent pitches one
half-step lower yet. Examples: To represent sharp 2 in the key
of B major, double-sharp the C degree, or (equally good)
double-sharp the third space (G clef). To represent flat 6 in
the key of D flat major, double-flat the B degree, or (equally
good) double flat the third line (G clef). <i>Do not say</i>: &quot;Put
a double-sharp on 6&quot; or &quot;put a double-sharp on C,&quot; or
&quot;<i>indicate&quot;</i> a higher or lower pitch &quot;<i>on</i>&quot; a sharped or
flatted degree.</p>

<p>12. <i>Signature:</i> Sharps or flats used as signatures affect the
staff de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>grees they occupy and all octaves of the same.
Example: With signature of four sharps, the first one affects
the fifth line and the first space; the second, the third
space; the third, the space above and the second line; the
fourth, the fourth line and the space below. <i>Do not say</i>: &quot;F
and C are sharped,&quot; &quot;ti is sharped,&quot; &quot;B is flatted,&quot; &quot;fa is
flatted.&quot; &quot;Sharpened&quot; or &quot;flattened&quot; are undesirable.</p>

<p>13. <i>Brace:</i> The two or more staffs containing parts to be
sounded together; also the vertical line or bracket connecting
such staffs. <i>Not</i> &quot;line&quot; or &quot;score.&quot; &quot;Staff&quot; is better than
&quot;line&quot; for a single staff, and &quot;score&quot; is used meaning the
book containing an entire work, as &quot;vocal score,&quot; &quot;orchestral
score,&quot; &quot;full score.&quot;</p>

<p>14. <i>Notes:</i> Notes are characters designed to represent
relative duration. When placed on staff-degrees they
<i>indicate</i> pitch. (Note the difference between &quot;represent&quot; and
&quot;indicate.&quot;) &quot;Sing what the note calls for&quot; means, sing a tone
of the pitch represented by the staff degree occupied by the
note-head. The answer to the question: &quot;What is that note?&quot;
would be &quot;half-note,&quot; &quot;eighth-note&quot; according to the
denomination of the note in question, whether it was on or off
the staff.</p>

<p>15. <i>Measure-sign:</i> 4-4, 2-4, 6-8, are <i>measure-signs</i>. Avoid
&quot;time signatures,&quot; &quot;meter-signatures,&quot; &quot;the fraction,&quot;
&quot;time-marks.&quot; Example: What is the measure-sign? (C) Ans. A
broken circle. What is its meaning? Ans. Four-quarter measure.
(Not four-four time, four-four rhythm, four-four meter.)</p>

<p>16. <i>Note Placing:</i> Place a quarter note on the fourth line.
Not &quot;put a quarter note on D.&quot;</p>

<p>17. <i>Beat-Pulse:</i> A tone or rest occurs on a certain beat or
pulse of a measure. Not on a certain <i>count</i>.</p>

<p>18. <i>Signature Terminology:</i> The right hand sharp in the
signature is on the staff degree that represents seven of the
major scale. Not &quot;always on 7 or ti.&quot;</p>

<p>19. <i>Signature Terminology:</i> The right hand flat in the
signature is on the staff degree that represents four of the
major scale. Not &quot;always on fa.&quot;</p>

<p>20. <i>Rote, Note, Syllable:</i> Singing by rote means that the
singer sings something learned by ear without regard to notes.
Singing by note means that the singer is guided to the correct
pitch by visible notes. Singing by syllable means that the
singer sings the tones of a song or part to the sol-fa
syllables instead of to words, neutral vowels or the hum.
&quot;Sing by note&quot; is not correct if the direction means simply to
sing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> sol-fa syllables, whether in sight reading, rote
singing, or memory work. &quot;Sing by syllable&quot; would be correct
in each case.</p>


<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Adoptions of the 1911 Meeting at San Francisco</span></p>

<p>Arabic numerals, either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, or 12, placed on the
staff directly after the signature and above the third line,
show the number of beats in a measure.</p>

<p>A note, either a quarter or a dotted quarter, placed in
parenthesis under the numeral, represents the length of one
beat and is called the beat-note.</p>

<p>The numeral and the beat-note thus grouped constitute the
measure-sign.</p>

<p>Illustrative statements covering proper terminology: the tune
&quot;America&quot; is written in three-quarter measure. The chorus:
&quot;How lovely are the Messengers&quot; is written in two-dotted
quarter measure.</p>

<p>The above forms of statement were adopted at Denver in 1909,
and are recommended for general use when speaking of music
written with the conventional measure-signs, etc.</p>

<p>In place of: &quot;two-two time, three-eight time, four-four time,&quot;
say as above: &quot;This piece is written in two-half measure,
three-eighth measure, four-quarter measure.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Adoptions of the 1912 Meeting at Chicago</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Pulse and Beat</i></p>

<p>The Committee finds that the words: Pulse and Beat are in
general use as synonymous terms, meaning one of the succession
of throbs or impulses of which we are conscious when listening
to music. Each of these pulses or beats has an exact point of
beginning, a duration, and an exact point of ending, the
latter coincident with the beginning of the next pulse or
beat. When thus used, both words are terms of ear.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Beat</i></p>

<p>One of these words, Beat, is also in universal use, meaning
one of a series of physical motions by means of which a
conductor holds his group of performers to a uniform movement.</p>

<p>When thus used it becomes a term of eye.</p>

<p>The conductor's baton, if it is to be authoritative, cannot
wander about through the whole duration of the pulse but must
move quickly to a point of comparative repose, remaining until
just before the arrival of the next pulse when it again makes
a rapid swing, finishing coincidently with the initial tone
(or silence) of the new pulse.</p>

<p>Thus it is practically the end of the conductor's beat that
marks the beginning of the pulse.</p>

<p>The Committee is of opinion that Beat might preferably be used
as indicating the outward sign.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Beat-Note</i></p>

<p>This term &quot;beat-note&quot; is already in use in another important
connection (see Terminology Report, 1911) and the Committee
recommends that those using the above terms shall say: &quot;This
note is an on-the-beat note; this one is an after-the-beat
note; this one a before-the-beat note.&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>


<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Definitions</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Matters of Ear</i></p>

<p>Pulse: The unit of movement in music, one of a series of
regularly recurring throbs or impulses.</p>

<p>Measure: A group of pulses.</p>

<p>Pulse-Group: Two or more tones grouped within the pulse.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Matters of Eye</i></p>

<p>Beat: One of a series of conventional movements made by the
conductor. This might include any unconventional motion which
served to mark the movement of the music, whether made by
conductor, performer or auditor.</p>

<p>Beat-Note: A note of the denomination indicated by the
measure-sign as the unit of note-value in a given measure.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Example</i></p>

<p>Given the following measure-signs: 2-4, 2-2, 2-8, quarter,
half, or eighth notes, respectively, are beat-notes.</p>

<p>Beat-Group: A group of notes or notes and rests, of smaller
denomination than the beat-note which represents a full beat
from beginning to end and is equal in value to the beat-note.
(A beat-group may begin with a rest.)</p>

<p>On-the-Beat Note (or rest): Any note (or rest) ranging in
value from a full beat down, which calls for musical action
(or inaction) synchronously with the conductor's beat.</p>

<p>After-the-Beat Note: Any note in a beat-group which indicates
that a tone is to be sounded after the beginning, and before
or at the middle of the pulse.</p>

<p>Before-the-Beat Note: Any note in a beat-group which indicates
that a tone is to be sounded after the middle of the pulse.</p>

<p>To illustrate terminology and to differentiate between Pulse
and Beat as terms, respectively of ear and eye, the following
is submitted:</p>

<p>Whenever a brief tone involves the musical idea of
syncopation, it may be regarded as an after-the-pulse tone and
the note that calls for it as an after-the-beat note; when it
involves the idea of anticipation or preparation it may be
regarded as a before-the-pulse tone, and the note that calls
for it, as a before-the-beat note.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>&quot;What is the measure-sign?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is the meter-signature?&quot;</p>

<p>These two words are used synonymously, and one of them is
unnecessary. The Committee recommends that Measure be retained
and used. Meter has its use in connection with hymns.</p></div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The author does not find it possible at present to agree with all the
recommendations made in the above report, but the summary is printed in
full for the sake of completeness.</p>

<p>The Music Teacher's National Association has also interested itself
mildly in the subject of terminology reform, and at its meeting in
Washington, D.C., in 1908, Professor Waldo S. Pratt gave his address as
president of the Association on the subject &quot;System and Precision in
Musical Speech.&quot; This address interested the members of the Association
to such an extent that Professor Pratt was asked to act as a committee
whose purpose it should be to look into the matter of reforms necessary
in music terminology and report at a later session. In 1910 Professor
Pratt read a report in which he advocated the idea of making some
changes in music nomenclature, but took the ground that the subject is
too comprehensive to be mastered in the short time that can be given to
it by a committee, and that it is therefore impossible to recommend
specific changes. He also took occasion to remark that one difficulty in
the whole matter of terminology is that many terms and expressions are
used <i>colloquially</i> and that such use although usually not scientific,
is often not distinctly harmful and is not of sufficient importance to
cause undue excitement on the part of reformers. Quoting from the report
at this point:&#8212;&quot;A great deal of confusion is more apparent than real
between <i>note</i> and <i>tone</i>, between <i>step</i> and <i>degree</i>, between <i>key</i>
and <i>tonality</i>. No practical harm is done by speaking of the <i>first
note</i> of a piece when really <i>first tone</i> would be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> accurate. To
say that a piece is written <i>in the key of B<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span></i> is more convenient
than to say that it is written in the <i>tonality of which B<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> is the
tonic</i>. The truth is that some of the niceties of expression upon which
insistence is occasionally laid are merely fussy, not because they have
not some sort of reason, but because they fail to take into account the
practical difference between colloquial or off-hand speech and the
diction of a scientific treatise. This is said without forgetting that
colloquialism always needs watching and that some people form the habit
of being careless or positively uncouth as if it were a mark of high
artistic genius.&quot;</p>

<p>Professor Pratt's report is thus seen to be philosophic rather than
constructive, and terminology reform will undoubtedly make more
immediate progress through the efforts of the N.E.A. Committee with its
specific recommendations (even though these are sometimes admittedly
<i>fussy</i>) than through the policy of the M.T.N.A. of waiting for some one
to get time to take up the subject in a scholarly way. Nevertheless the
philosophic view is sometimes badly needed, especially when the spirit
of reform becomes too rabid and attaches too great importance to
trifles. A judicious intermingling of the two committees in a series of
joint meetings would undoubtedly result in mutual helpfulness, and
possibly also in a more tangible and convincing statement of principles
than has yet been formulated by either.</p>

<h2>FOOTNOTES</h2>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> It should be noted at the outset that this statement
regarding the down-turned stem on the left side of the note-head, and
also a number of similar principles here cited, refer more specifically
to music as it appears on the printed page. In the case of hand-copied
music the down-turned stem appears on the right side of the note, thus
<img src="images/quarter2.jpg" width="12" height="24" alt="quarter note" title="quarter note" />.
This is done because of greater facility in writing, and
for the same reason other slight modifications of the notation here
recommended may sometimes be encountered. In dealing with children it is
best usually to follow as closely as possible the principles according
to which <i>printed</i> music is notated, in order to avoid those
non-satisfying and often embarrassing explanations of differences which
will otherwise be unavoidable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> An exception to this rule occurs in the case of notes of
unequal value stroked together, when the hook appears on the left side,
thus <img src="images/unequal.jpg" width="41" height="31" alt="unequal beamed notes" title="unequal beamed notes" />.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> It is to be hoped that the figure for the double-flat
suggested by Mattheson (who also suggested the St. Andrew's cross
(<img src="images/standrew.jpg" width="12" height="12" alt="St. Andrew's cross" title="St. Andrew's cross" />) for the double-sharp) may some time be readopted. This figure
was the Greek letter B, made thus, <span lang="el" title="Greek: b">&#946;</span>, and its use would make
our notation one degree more uniform than it is at present.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The word <i>leger</i> is derived from the French word <i>L&#201;GER</i>,
meaning light, and this use of the word refers to the fact that the
leger lines, being added by hand, are lighter&#8212;<i>i.e.</i>, less solid in
color&#8212;than the printed lines of the staff itself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The word <i>clef</i> is derived from <i>CLAVIS</i>&#8212;a key&#8212;the
reference being to the fact that the clef unlocks or makes clear the
meaning of the staff, as a key to a puzzle enables us to solve the
puzzle.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The Germans use the same pitch designations as we do with
two exceptions, viz., our B is called by them H, and our B<span lang="el" title="flat">&#9837;</span> is
called B. The scale of C therefore reads: C, D, E, F, G, A, H, C; the
scale of F reads F, G, A, B, C, D, E, F. The signatures are in all cases
written exactly as we write them.
</p><p>
In France and Italy where the &quot;fixed DO&quot; system is in vogue, pitches are
usually referred to by the syllable names; <i>e.g.</i>, C is referred to as
DO (or UT), D as RE, etc.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The expression &quot;diatonic condition&quot; as here used refers to
the staff after the signature has been placed upon it, in other words
after the staff has been prepared to represent the pitches of the
diatonic scale.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> It has already been noted (<a href="#Page_6">p. 6</a>, Note) that in the German
scale our b-flat is called b, and our b is called H. From this
difference in terminology has grown up the custom of using the H (now
made <span lang="el" title="natural">&#9838;</span>) to show that <i>any</i> staff-degree is in <i>natural</i>
condition, <i>i.e.</i>, not sharped or flatted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The word <i>sin</i> is a contraction of the Italian
word <i>sino</i>, meaning &quot;as far as&quot; or &quot;until&quot;; in the term given
above (<a href="#SEC_39">Sec. 39</a>) it is really superfluous as the word <i>al</i>
includes in itself both preposition and article, meaning &quot;to
the.&quot;</p></div>

refers to the primitive instrument, the four strings of which were so
tuned that the lowest and the highest tones produced were a perfect
fourth apart. With the Greeks the tetrachord was the unit of analysis as
the octave is with us to-day, and all Greek scales are capable of
division into two tetrachords, the arrangement of the intervals between
the tones in each tetrachord differentiating one scale from another, but
the tetrachords themselves always consisting of groups of four tones,
the highest being a perfect fourth above the lowest.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The step-and-a-half (augmented second) is &quot;unmelodic&quot;
because it is the same size as a <i>minor third</i> and the mind finds it
difficult to take in as a <i>second</i> (notes representing it being on
adjacent staff-degrees) an interval of the same size as a third.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> These syllables are said to have been derived originally
from the initial syllables of the &quot;Hymn to Saint John,&quot; the music of
which was a typical Gregorian chant. The application of these syllables
to the scale tones will be made clear by reference to this hymn as given
below. It will be observed that this hymn provided syllables only for
the six tones of the <i>hexachord</i> then recognized; when the octave scale
was adopted (early in the sixteenth century) the initial letters of the
last line (s and i) were combined into a syllable for the seventh tone.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> A considerable number of teachers (particularly those who
did not learn to sing by syllable in childhood) object to calling the
tonic of the minor scale <i>la</i>, insisting that both major and minor tonic
should be called <i>do</i>. According to this plan the syllables used in
singing the harmonic minor scale would be: DO, RE, ME, FA, SOL, LE, TI,
DO.
</p><p>
There is no particular basis for this theory, for although all scales
must of course begin with the key-tone or tonic, this tonic may be
referred to by any syllable which will serve as a basis for an
association process enabling one to feel the force of the tone as a
closing point&#8212;a <i>home tone</i>. Thus in the Dorian mode the tonic would be
RE, in the Phrygian, MI, etc.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The student should differentiate between the so-called
&quot;tonality&quot; scales like the major and minor, the tones of which are
actually used as a basis for &quot;key-feeling&quot; with the familiar experience
of coming home to the tonic after a melodic or harmonic excursion, and
on the other hand the purely artificial and mechanical construction of
the chromatic scale.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Many other enharmonic notations are possible, altho the
&quot;five pairs of tones&quot; above referred to are the most common. Thus

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> The word <i>chromatic</i> means literally <i>colored</i> and was
first applied to the intermediate tones because by using them the singer
could get smoother and more diversely-shaded progressions, <i>i.e.</i>, could
get more <i>color</i> than by using only the diatonic tones. Composers were
not long discovering the peculiar value of these additional tones and
soon found that these same tones were exceedingly valuable also in
modulating, hence the two uses of intermediate tones at the present
time&#8212;first, to embellish a melody; second, to modulate to another key.</p></div>

A.D., the culmination of the polyphonic period being reached in the
music of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750). Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven,
and the later writers have used the monophonic style more than the
polyphonic, although a combination of the two is often found, as <i>e.g.</i>,
in the later works of Beethoven.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> The <i>tonic-sol-fa system</i> represents an attempt to invent
a simpler notation to be used by beginners, (especially in the lower
grades of the public schools) and by singers in choral societies who
have never learned to interpret staff notation and who therefore find
some simpler scheme of notation necessary if they are to read music at
all.
</p><p>
In this system the syllables <i>do</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>mi</i>, etc., (in phonetic
spelling) are used, the tone being arrived at in each case, first by
means of a firmly established sense of tonality, and second by
associating each diatonic tone with some universally felt emotional
feeling: thus <i>do</i> is referred to as the <i>strong</i> tone, <i>mi</i> as the
<i>calm</i> one, and <i>la</i> as the <i>sad</i> tone, great emphasis being placed upon
<i>do</i> as the center of the major tonality, and upon <i>la</i> as the center of
the minor. The system is thus seen to have one advantage over staff
notation, viz.: that in presenting it <i>the teacher is compelled to begin
with a presentation of actual tones</i>, while in many cases the teacher of
staff notation begins by presenting facts regarding the staff and other
symbols before the pupil knows anything about tone and rhythm as such.
</p><p>
The symbol for each diatonic tone is the initial letter of the syllable
(<i>i.e.</i>, d for <i>do</i>, r for <i>re</i>, etc.), the key being indicated by a
letter at the beginning of the composition. The duration-value of tones
is indicated by a system of bars, dots, and spaces, the bar being used
to indicate the strongest pulse of each measure (as in staff notation)
the beats being shown by the mark: a dash indicating the continuation of
the same tone through another beat. If a beat has two tones this is
indicated by writing the two initial letters representing them with a .
between them. A modulation is indicated by giving the new key letter and
by printing the syllable-initials from the standpoint of both the old
and the new <i>do</i>-position. The figure ' above and to the right of the
letter indicates the tone in the octave above, while the same figure
below and to the right indicates the octave below. A blank space
indicates a rest. The tune of My Country, 'Tis of Thee, as printed in
tonic sol-fa notation below will make these points clear.
</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>Key F</p>
<p>
| d :d :r | t<sub>1</sub> :-.d :r | m :m :f | m :-.r :d | r :d :t<sub>1</sub> | d :&#8212; :&#8212; |<br />
| s :s :s | s :-.f :m | f :f :f | f :-.m :r | m :f.m :r.d | m :-.f :s |<br />
| l.f :m :r | d :&#8212; :&#8212; |
</p></div>
<p>
The advantages of the system are (1) the strong sense of key-feeling
aroused and the ease with which modulations are felt; and (2) the fact
that it is necessary to learn to sing in but one key, thus making
sight-singing a much simpler matter, and transposition the easiest
process imaginable. But these are advantages from the standpoint of the
vocalist (producing but one tone at a time) only, and do not apply to
instrumental music. The scheme will therefore probably be always
restricted to vocal music and will hardly come into very extensive use
even in this field, for the teacher of music is finding it perfectly
possible to improve methods of presentation to such an extent that
learning to sing from the staff becomes a very simple matter even to the
young child. And even though this were not true, the tonic-sol-fa will
always be hampered by the fact that since all letters are printed in a
straight horizontal line the ear does not have the assistance of the eye
in appreciating the rise and fall of melody, as is the case in staff
notation.</p></div>

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
